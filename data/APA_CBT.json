I usually take up, pretty frugal that way.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. No, it sounds like you're seizing an opportunity and we're gonna make the best use of it.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: That's terrific. That's terrific. So I definitely wanna hear more about the anxiety and then so one of the things that I was hoping to do here today is to hear a bit more specifically what you're experiencing in terms of anxiety and I saw in here there's a little bit of depression as well. So we'll kind of talk about, not only those emotional experiences that you're having, but also some of the things going on in your life, the stressers and things that might trigger some of the depression and anxiety. And as you're talking I will link what you're talking about to the questionnaire here, to some of the responses that you made on here. And then I'll also link it to this model right here. This is the cognitive behavioral model that underlies the particular type of therapy that I do, cognitive behavioral therapy. And this is a way of just really making sense of your emotional experiences and other experiences in your life. So as you're telling me about this, we'll kind of make sense of it in terms of this model so you can start to understand how the pieces get put together.\nJOSH: Sure.\nAMY WENZEL: How does that sound?\nJOSH: Uh, yeah, that sounds fine. It looks a good, looks like a pretty textbook model.\nAMY WENZEL: Textbook model, you got it. You got it.\nJOSH: Very professional.\nAMY WENZEL: Good. Good. You know, the other thing I was hoping to do here today was just share a little bit more about what cognitive behavioral therapy's all about and just hear from you if you think it's a good match or if there's some things that you think might pose some obstacles to some of our work together in the future.\n\nJOSH: Sure.\nAMY WENZEL: Sound okay?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So tell me a little bit more about the anxiety.\nJOSH: Um, my anxiety, I guess a good way to track my anxiety would be just like my educational experience. Since when I was 18, if you would've asked me what I'd be doing now I'd be taking over the world. I'm 24. I've been in school for six years and I get my bachelor's degree in May. And a lot of that, I think about two years into my college education I just really developed some sort of anxiety, just like this, I wanna call it, almost like a fog in my head where certain things became harder.\nAMY WENZEL: How difficult.\nJOSH: The closer to school related it is, the harder it became.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Right before I really started getting a lot of anxiety I became involved in a business fraternity. And we actually started on campus at ISU. But over the course of two semesters, I completely fell out of the group of friends I was with. I went from being the social chair to just not showing up. I took a semester off and then never went back to the fraternity.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So I've definitely gone down since then but I've come back up since then too.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Good to hear that. Good to hear that. So when you started off by saying, boy, when you were 18 you thought you were gonna take over the world, I'm taking that as that you didn't really have problems with anxiety up until that time. Is that correct?\nJOSH: No. Even up until I was maybe like 19 or 20.\nAMY WENZEL: 19 or 20. Like one or two years in.\nJOSH: I mean, I was always very educationally sound. I always had a lot of ambition. I was the young entrepreneur on the block, you know?\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, really.\nJOSH: So yeah, you needed something done around your house, the odds are you could find me to do it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So you were ambitious. You were entrepreneurial.\nJOSH: Very ambitious. Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. You went to a four year school. Sounds like you were gonna major in business.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah, I actually went into accounting.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. You went into accounting. And then, so tell me a little bit more about that period when you had the onset of that fog and the anxiety.\nJOSH: Um, it was the winter time when I first noticed it. I guess looking back now I probably didn't realize it then. I probably just brushed it off as a seasonal disorder, something like that. I remember telling my grandmother on the phone about it and she's, my grandmother's kind of a close mentor for me, and she told me to go to see somebody. And they diagnosed me with just really mild depression and anxiety. But.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So it sounds like there was no specific trigger.\nJOSH: There certainly were a few things in my life. I'm sorry, I was trying to think what the original question was.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: I had a breakup with a high school sweetheart. I don't wanna say that was it. I was living away from home. I had that stresser. And I had just moved out of the dormitories into an apartment. So there's the not being cradled by the university anymore.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And my parents started getting their divorce, which didn't really affect me as much, I don't know, I was away from home. But maybe affected me, I just didn't realize it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So it sounds like you didn't have a history of depression or anxiety prior to this period. What about anybody that your biologically related to in your family?\nJOSH: Um, my mother had, I believe I remember hearing she had post baby depression, postpartum depression.\nAMY WENZEL: Postpartum depression.\nJOSH: And I know she's had an anxiety attack or two in her life.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I don't know too much about her experiences and all. But I know she's experienced it in the past. And then of course with the divorce, you ask which parent what's wrong with the other one, they'll give you a whole list of medical; she's bipolar, she's this, he's that.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. Sure. Okay.\nJOSH: Most people I'm with would say I'm nothing like my parents.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Cause I work in a family business.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. Okay.\nJOSH: So they all know my parents.\nAMY WENZEL: So the reason I was asking that question about your family is because I'm trying to put this together now into an understanding of the onset of your anxiety. And one of our models of depression and anxiety that we oftentimes use in our field is something called a vulnerability stress model. And a vulnerability could be like a genetic predisposition to depression or anxiety. And one of the ways we know if a person has a genetic predisposition is if they have a family history of depression or anxiety. So you know the way I'm starting to understand this is that you might have this vulnerability and when things are going well and you're successful and entrepreneurial, you're not experiencing any symptoms. But it sounds like you had a trifecta of stress there, a transition between the breakup, the moving out of the comfort of the university taking care of you into the apartment, and then your parents' divorce. And so that was a stresser, that really sort of brought that anxiety out or brought it to the next level.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Does that resonate with you?\nJOSH: Yeah, certainly, like the perfect storm.\nAMY WENZEL: Perfect storm. You got it. So then you experienced it as fog, you said.\nJOSH: I just didn't wanna do anything with anyone. You have those classes in college where you go every day. You have the classes where you go Tuesday and Thursday and... I mean, I would just be sitting in class saying, \"Okay, after this next slide I'm gonna leave.\" Cause I turned to my homework, I don't need to be in class. And then it just got worse from there.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated Psychological template:\n",

And then I would still always do the homework and everything but I just fell behind.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So you fell behind and then you said it got the point where you took a semester off from Illinois State. Correct?\nJOSH: Uh, not completely a semester. I just took a really light load and then I took off from the fraternity. So my membership was in pause or on hold or something. And then I just never went back to that. But I was always enrolled with the university.\nAMY WENZEL: Always enrolled in university. And you said since that time there's been basically ups and downs. Is that right?\nJOSH: Yeah. One big down and hopefully one last big up. But I mean there were times where I would just lay in bed and not be able to go to class. Not because I wasn't smart enough or I didn't have the material or anything but I was sure that if I did the homework I would get good grades, no doubt about it. But...\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. Why don't we fast forward and tell me about the past month then, in terms of some of the depression and anxiety. What's been going on now?\nJOSH: The past month, I think if I look back next year, this'll be the hardest couple, the hardest six months in the past five years of my life. I've really just grabbed the bull by the horns, I think. And if I don't succeed this semester it's just gonna be game over for college for me. I'm graduating in May.\nAMY WENZEL: Good for you.\nJOSH: I have a full load of classes. And I'm trying to study for the enrollment exam for the IRS.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, terrific.\nJOSH: So I feel good about it. And I've been dieting and exercising. And I think that really helps with my mood and just being really positive.\nAMY WENZEL: So you described it as the hardest six months but it sounds like hardest in terms of working hard and accomplishing. Okay.\n\n\nJOSH: But I mean there's just, I had a quiz the other day I just didn't do. You know so every once in a while I slip up like that and I have to really, for me it's more about getting into the habit of doing it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: You've heard of the power of the habit, the book.\nAMY WENZEL: I sure have. I sure have. Yeah, so this is interesting because both in your paperwork as well as a couple things you said here suggest that the anxiety and depression are mainly now related to academic issues or academic stressers.\nJOSH: Academic stressers and just like succeeding and like what I feel I'm supposed to be doing in life at this point.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So let's take this specific example of the quiz that you didn't do very well on. When was that?\nJOSH: That was two weeks ago over the weekend. I didn't do well on it, I just didn't do it. I read the chapter of the book. I couldn't do it. Between Friday, Saturday and Sunday night and I found a reason not to do it every single night until Monday morning. I'm just kicking myself cause I didn't do it.\nAMY WENZEL: You didn't do the reading? Or you didn't take the...\nJOSH: I did the reading. I did the work. I didn't log onto blackboard our website and I didn't hit begin quiz.\nAMY WENZEL: I see.\nJOSH: And then go through the ten questions.\nAMY WENZEL: That's what I was missing. It was an online quiz.\nJOSH: And it's like three points for the class. I understand how every point in the class works. Four points I had to do to get an A. You can take the quiz three times without any penalty, write down the answer every time, you get an A on the quiz. I usually do that.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I just, sometimes I just freeze up.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Let's talk about hat freezing a little bit more. So when you're over the weekend, you've read the book or you've read the chapter, you're contemplating taking the quiz, tell me what runs through your mind?\nJOSH: I just, I try to keep things from running through my mind. I try not to think about em. I'll get busy with something else. You know there'll be, I'll start looking at condos for my girlfriend on Craig's List and spend an hour doing that. I'll do laundry, I'll clean everything. My room'll be spotless. Everything, my car'll be clean.\nAMY WENZEL: Lots of avoidance, huh?\nJOSH: Yeah, avoidance. I put everything else on the way that needs to be done. You got something that needs to be done, when I have something that needs to be done it's probably the best time to ask me to do it. Cause I don't wanna do what I have to do.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So if you are forced to direct your attention to what you have to do, what would jump into your mind?\nJOSH: I mean, usually when I think of forced I think, \"Oh God, it's the last minute to apply to graduate\" forced. And then I just do it. Just bite the bullet and do it. It's a really hard zone for me to get in. But certainly I can get into it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So do you ever have any thoughts like, \"I'm not gonna do well. I'm gonna fail.\"\nJOSH: Yeah, certainly. Yeah. Definitely a fear of success type thing going on. You know.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I switched majors twice in college.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh did you? Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: From accounting to finance and from finance to information systems.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So I have all those credits and GSU put me into the interdisciplinaries program because I had so many upper division credits but not one clear focus. So the last year in college I just spent focusing on accounting.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Do you think the jumping from major to major, was that another indication of this avoidance pattern?\nJOSH: Yeah. I don't know what I'm gonna do when I graduate college. I've been, it's the education, your entire life. I didn't feel like I was ready when I was an information systems major. And then I switched back to accounting. But...\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So let's say you graduate and you're still a bit unsure here. Tell me about some of the things that you worry about.\nJOSH: Um, right now in my life I'm trying to move up to the city, Chicago, to live with a girlfriend. And the girlfriend's becoming a main motivator to do anything anymore cause you can't live at Mom and Dad's house the rest of your life. Especially when they're getting divorced.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: So,\nAMY WENZEL: Hence looking for a condo.\nJOSH: Yeah. So I'm just trying to move, trying to get a job. I'll take any job that you have to have a four year degree to take. So, the true requirement is to have a job for me.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Is it safe to say that you worry about things?\nJOSH: Oh yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Tell me some more about your worries.\nJOSH: Money is always a big worrier. I live from paycheck to paycheck. Um, buying books. I just got done buying books for the semester. The semester started like three weeks ago.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So I kinda pay for things as they come. And then this past month or two I felt really good about myself cause I've been taking care of things. And my credit report that I didn't pay for, that I issued into normal. I paid off a thousand dollars for the past two months. Yeah. But now I don't have much of a tax return left.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: I don't know. I'm just trying to watch myself out there right now.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So you're worrying about money. What else are you worrying about?\nJOSH: Moving.\nAMY WENZEL: Moving. Okay.\n\nJOSH: And do you fundamentally do you focus on bad things that might happen, like things not working out?\nAMY WENZEL: Focus on like the worst case scenarios of what could happen. Like, \"Oh my God Josh, if you don't get back on the computer, type that email to that person and tell them this that you were supposed to tell em this morning, you're gonna be...\"\nAnd when you focus on those worst case scenarios, what does that do to your mood?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

What does it do to your anxiety level?\nJOSH: Um, if I get on the track where I know I'm gonna get it done, my anxiety level goes down. But until there's that moment of relief, it's gonna be okay. Like, I couldn't, the 50 dollars was due for the graduation fee on a Thursday and I got paid on a Friday. I didn't know if I was gonna be able to have the gas to get here and then.

You're gonna be stuck living...\nJOSH: If I don't graduate from college this semester, I just can't push it off for another semester. She graduated last year and I'm a year older than her.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: And she's got a great job and everything.\n\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Can I share with you this model a little bit in light of what you're saying here?\nJOSH: Certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: I'm gonna actually call your attention to this bottom rectangle right here. In cognitive behavioral therapy, cognitive means how we think about things or how we make meaning of things. I oftentimes find that when people struggle a bit with depression and anxiety, they tend to go to that worst case scenario, as you're saying. Or they tend to really focus on things that are excessively negative or excessively unhelpful at the expense of some other pieces of information that might soften out the interpretation a little bit. And I wonder if, and we call these automatic thoughts because they come up just so quickly that we don't even necessarily know that we're thinking them. We just know that we're anxious or we just know that we're upset. But a lot of time it can help us to slow down, recognize what we're thinking and then really take a good hard look at it to make sure that we're not forgetting about some other pieces that suggest that things aren't quite so catastrophic. I'm wondering what you think about that? I mean, do you think that's relevant to you?\nJOSH: Certainly. I mean an automatic thought, just the worst case scenario that I would have. Yeah, I mean. It pops in my head. Sometimes where I have a big failure or I think I have a big failure, I go, \"Oh, stuck in this town for another year.\" And so I'm unable to overcome it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But I mean, I see the rules and assumptions, I just assume I have to live in Joliet the rest of my life if I don't graduate college.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. That's so important there. Let's talk a little bit more about the other pieces of the model. So these automatic thoughts, we kinda start at this level because they come up in particular situations and they're the easiest types of thoughts or cognitions to identify. But there are all these layers that kinda of are underneath the automatic thoughts. And you're absolutely right that people then hold these rules and assumptions like a number of patients I've worked with have had assumptions like, \"I should get all As or else I'm a failure.\" Or, \"I should graduate in a certain amount of time.\" And it just puts so much pressure on them that then it's very easy to jump to these worst case scenarios when they're faced with some sort of stresser. Does that seem like that resonates with you?\nJOSH: Yeah. Certainly. I think it's pretty in line with what happens to me.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: I don't really understand. What's the, can you tell me what the formative experience is?\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely. Absolutely. So according to this model, oftentimes people have experiences, formative experiences just means a key experience from your life that really shaped the way that you view the world or you approach life. And so oftentimes we have these experiences, perhaps with our parents, perhaps with our peers.\nJOSH: Adolescence.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. It could be adolescence. Although it doesn't always have to be limited to childhood like I actually wonder if the experience that you had at ISU when you started to have all the stressers and have difficulties with the transition, might have been another formative experience that sort of stuck with you and affects the way that you view the world. Is there any truth to that hypothesis?\nJOSH: Yeah. Definitely. I mean, I have a different view towards university in general now.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: Towards any educational institution, I have a different view towards.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: At this point.\nAMY WENZEL: Exactly. So that really kind of rocked your world a bit because up to that point you had a very different outlook about school.\nJOSH: Yeah, I was much more optimistic.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay, okay. And oftentimes these formative experiences lead to what we call these core beliefs. And these are kind of, this is the most fundamental level of cognition. It's a belief that you have about yourself or about the way the world works or other people that oftentimes just serves as a lens or filter by which you view the world. And I wonder with you, especially because of this experience that you had at ISU, if there's a bit of a fear of failure or this belief that you are a failure or that you won't be successful.\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean I have a big fear of failure. But a lot of it comes from just comparing myself, cause I was in league with a lot of really successful people. And going on Facebook now can be really anxiety causing.\nAMY WENZEL: Facebook is dangerous for that.\nJOSH: You just go through, oh that's a really nice house you bought. First job out of college. I wish I had stuck in school longer like you did or done what you did while I was there.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But I mean...\nAMY WENZEL: So it sounds like and actually interestingly Facebook could almost be like another formative experience, not exactly like one thing that happened to you like what happened at ISU. But it's like kind of a continual ambush, where you're getting this message of it sounds like maybe what you're making out of that that is that you're not good enough or as good as other people.\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean that might be why I go to Governor State University. Because I wanted to be a bigger fish in a smaller pond.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Yeah, and what you're actually identifying there is not even actually something that's on our model but that's still important. We call that a compensatory strategy. Where you're doing something that compensates for a core belief that's painful to face.\nJOSH: I have a lot of compensatory...\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah? What are some of the other compensatory strategies?\nJOSH: I mean just like I have to make habits to do things. Even going into classes now. Last semester, I show up to school like a half hour, 45 minutes ahead of time.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: And I'll sit in my car and I'll eat. I'll listen to the radio. Some podcast or something. I just have to relax myself on campus before I go into class. I need to be in like that state of mind.\nAMY WENZEL: And what if you don't relax yourself and center yourself like that?\nJOSH: If I am running 20 minutes on the highway and I'm not gonna make it to class on time, why even go to class now?\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, okay.\nJOSH: If you turn on the highway now you could be home in how long? What would your mom say? What would your girlfriend say if she found out you're missing class?\nAMY WENZEL: Sure, sure.\nJOSH: And then anxiety just hits.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Because then the worst thing I could do that I know for myself in academics with classes is miss a class. Cause that class, after that class you missed, is twice as hard to go to.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Yeah.\nJOSH: Because you get all this anxiety, \"Oh my God, I'm gonna walk in and everybody's gonna look at me and know oh he wasn't here last week.\" Especially at GSU because you only meet once a week.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. And you know what you're doing right, that's actually another automatic thought. Everyone's gonna know that I wasn't here. Right? And it sounds like there's some truth to that at a smaller university like this. I wonder what the implications with that would be. So what if everybody knows that you didn't...\nJOSH: I thought that in a 50 person class but not every day in a 200 person class at some of the bigger universities, you know.\nAMY WENZEL: I see. And even so that thought kinda got you into trouble there.\nJOSH: Yeah. Certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. What do you think of how we're making sense of your whole experience so far? Is that resonating with you?\nJOSH: I mean, yeah, it's true. It's definitely a formative way to put it.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Am I sensing a hesitation or is there a piece that we're missing?\nJOSH: I mean, no, I mean I don't know, I don't really like looking back at experiences I guess. Cause they make me anxious. So I mean, I look at a chart like that it's like thinking I'd rather have the arrows go the other way, like what I could be doing.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. Sure.\nJOSH: To get around my problems.\nAMY WENZEL: But you know we can conceptualize. I think that's actually quite creative. I mean, we can make the arrows go in the other direction because you've mentioned habits a couple of times now. And I honestly view some of this negative thinking as a cognitive habit and then of course avoidance is a behavioral habit as well as some of the other habits that we had talked about. And so unhelpful habits can get ingrained in our mind and in our repertoire. But then more helpful ways of thinking and behaving can also get ingrained in our mind and our repertoire and that's where the arrows would go in the other direction. And that's what you and I can do together.\nJOSH: Sure.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. So already as I'm thinking about this, part of what we can do is we can start with working with automatic thoughts that are certainly linked to these beliefs and assumptions. And I can give you some tools to really take a look at when these thinking patterns come up, take a step back, really evaluate everything that goes into them. And then, if necessary, modify them on the basis of the result of that evaluation. If you're realizing that you're forgetting to look at a whole bunch of pieces of the situation that would make it easier to tolerate, we need to make sure that you are incorporating that in to your thinking.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Does that make sense?\nJOSH: Yeah, it makes perfect sense. It's just gonna be hard, you know, when I go to work tomorrow and you have to put it into practice then.\n\n\nAMY WENZEL: Sure, sure. Tell me what you envision would be so difficult.\nJOSH: I mean I just have I guess a certain personality at work where I have to be respected and get things done a certain way. I don't know, I just feel like I couldn't stop and hesitate the way I do something.\nAMY WENZEL: Because, so complete the sentence; if I stop and think for a second, if I hesitate, then;\nJOSH: I guess there's nothing really that bad about it. Maybe I'm just making excuses for myself.\nAMY WENZEL: You know I don't actually view it as an excuse, I actually view it as another automatic thought that I wonder if somehow others won't view you as respectful or others might think something's going on.\nJOSH: Yeah. Certainly. Um, I don't know. I just have a lot of, things are going well at work how they are and changing them might be problematic because it's a family business and things are fragile.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh sure. So there's a lot of dynamics there. Right?\nJOSH: Yeah. I'm like the only person who works in the office every day that's related to the family. And I get a lot of...\nAMY WENZEL: Let me tell you something about cognitive behavioral therapy. It's a very collaborative therapy. So I certainly have expertise about psychotherapy in general and cognitive behavioral therapy. But you are absolutely the expert on your own situation and those dynamics. And so you and I are, we're both in the front of the car, we're both in, one of us is in the driver's seat, you're in the driver's seat, I'm in the passenger seat. Okay? So what that means is I will never force you or tell you that you have to do nay of the stuff in any one setting.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So, it'll be up to you to kind of take what we're doing and we can figure out how to make that apply and how to really mold it for your situation. Everybody's different.\nJOSH: So if you had to say like one particular exercise I could do like until I see you next week, what would it be?\nAMY WENZEL: Oh my gosh. You are a great candidate for cognitive behavioral therapy. Because that's actually something that we do.\nJOSH: I just wanna understand how...\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Let me actually, I'll go ahead and give you some here. And as I'm finding the sheet I wanna give you, let me also finish my thought here and that is that while of course I'll never just tell you what to do or never force you to do something, I might actually ask you to see if you'd consider testing out a hypothesis. That if you were to do something somewhat differently that the outcome would be catastrophic. You know we actually can experiment with that and we can actually collect information as it's happening in order to verify whether some of these worst case scenarios or catastrophes are actually true.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: What do you think of that?\nJOSH: I could do that.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So here's something I often start off with with my clients. That first sheet it's an informational sheet about automatic thoughts so some of it describes exactly what I've already been talking about here. Some questions to prompt the automatic thoughts. Yeah, go ahead and flip over to that second page. Because this is one way for you to start to recognize those automatic thoughts. And we call this a thought record. And so you'll notice there's three columns there. So when you experience a situation where you notice anxiety, trepidation, maybe some depression or even dread, you haven't used the word dread but I'm kind of sensing at times there's a little dread there. Jot a few words about what the situation was that prompted that. Mind you sometimes it's not always a situation. Sometimes it just kind of comes up like when you wake up in the morning or what not. So it doesn't always have to be external. Write down what the automatic thought was or maybe there's more than one thought. What was running through your mind. And then write down what emotion you were experiencing. You can rate the intensity of the emotion on a zero to 100 scale.\nJOSH: Does the situation have to be like a realizable event of something that happens? Or can it just be...\nAMY WENZEL: It's sort of like a worst case scenario again.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, no it absolutely doesn't have to be something external. You know I actually wanna do, you wanna grab the clipboard and the pen and maybe we can do one together so you have that to take home?\nJOSH: Sure. What situation would you like to do?\nAMY WENZEL: Well what situation would you like? Just over the past few days, where were you the most anxious?\nJOSH: Um, Monday I wanted to leave work early for no reason.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And I guess I didn't know why.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So kind of the situation was an urge to leave work.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I get those a lot.\nAMY WENZEL: Urge to leave work. Okay.\nJOSH: Okay. Thought.\nAMY WENZEL: What thought was running through your mind?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

That's sort of representative of those worst case scenarios?\nJOSH: Yeah, I was gonna miss the exam at 7:30, even though I got off at work at 5:30. Takes me 45 minutes to get here.\nAMY WENZEL: I see.\nJOSH: Only had two hours to do it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: Still worried.\nAMY WENZEL: But you thought you were gonna miss the exam.\nJOSH: Well it was snowing really bad.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: And they did end up canceling the exam.\nAMY WENZEL: Interesting. You know what? And this is a great example because you know oftentimes in these automatic thoughts, there is a grain of truth. I mean we're not, I would hate for you to get the message that we think that you're thinking totally abnormally or dysfunctionally. But it sounds like there were a number of factors in that statement that you probably weren't accounting for. The fact that you still had adequate time. That kind of thing. So is anxiety the emotion there?\nJOSH: Oh, certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And on the scale of zero to 100, how intense was the anxiety?\nJOSH: Um, maybe like a four or a five, so 40 or 50.\nAMY WENZEL: 40/50. Okay. Go ahead and write that down.\nJOSH: Um, I always wanna leave work early, I hate staying till 5:30.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: I even left earlier that I was supposed to today.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. One other question about this particular automatic thought before I follow up in the work issue. Were there any, was there even more meaning associated with I'm gonna miss the exam? You know like some sort of this is gonna...\nJOSH: Just the domino effect of missing an exam.\nAMY WENZEL: Which would be what?\nJOSH: Failure.\nAMY WENZEL: There you go. I wonder if you should writ that underneath that, or next to that, like, \"I'm gonna fail.\" Okay.\nJOSH: I didn't want my professor to think less of me.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. My professor's going to think less of me. There you go. Okay. So when you look at the totality of those thoughts, like I'm gonna miss the exam, my professor's gonna think poorly of me, and I'm gonna fail, are you still at a 40 or a 50 or does your anxiety go up then even more?\nJOSH: I mean maybe. When I think about just the urge to leave work at any given day it's 40 to 50. But I guess it would be higher when you account for the exam thing.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. And you know this is a perfect illustration of why we do this with folks because remember I said these come up so automatically that sometimes you don't even realize they're there? So yeah, you have a baseline level of 40 or 50 of an urge to leave work and some discomfort there. But in this case, the anxiety was probably even higher because you were what we call catastrophizing, right? About the implications.\nJOSH: Certainly. Yeah. It's a good word.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. So...\nJOSH: I don't know how to spell it.\nAMY WENZEL: Catastrophizing, we'll figure it out after to make sure you have that written down. So.\nJOSH: Should I raise the number?\nAMY WENZEL: If you think that raising the number is in order, you know, after looking at those other thoughts that you had. Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: Probably much higher.\nAMY WENZEL: There you go. So when you stop to think about it, there are actually quite a few catastrophic thoughts there that were really elevating your anxiety. Correct?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. In between now and our next visit, would you be willing to keep this thought record and keep a log of times where you're experiencing anxiety or depression?\nJOSH: Yeah, I can try to do that.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. And identifying the automatic thought. And what I have for you next time is some more material in order to start to figure out what to do with these thoughts.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: How does that sound?\nJOSH: Yeah, that sounds fine.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I'll try to take them seriously.\n\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. What's the likelihood that you'll do that?\nJOSH: Um, Monday through Friday pretty high.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: That's all I need right.\nAMY WENZEL: Well it sounds like Monday through Friday is when the anxiety and depression is prompted the most. Right? But if there are events on the weekends, where you're also feeling like that, I would encourage you to generalize the exercise to that. Okay. Where would you keep that paper?\nJOSH: Probably in my car.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: My car's like my office.\nAMY WENZEL: The car's like your office? Okay.\nJOSH: It's the only thing I own.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So if you say experience some of these, like you're walking around campus here or maybe at work, like when you're at work in the building, how would you know? Would you go up to your car to write these down?\nJOSH: I always have a pen and paper on me.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: So I can even take a picture of it.\nAMY WENZEL: There you go. Modern technology.\nJOSH: I'm very organized. I can put it, and it'll be everywhere.\nAMY WENZEL: You know what? That is a terrific observation. I have more and more of my own clients actually recording these in note functions and smartphones for that exact reason. So you don't have to use this form. You can certainly put it in your phone.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: That wouldn't be hard at all.\n\n\nAMY WENZEL: You know, I have one question for you on the basis of something you said and then I'm actually wondering if we could end our time here with putting together a specific game-plan for what we want to accomplish across all of the sessions. Does that sound okay?\nJOSH: Sure.\nAMY WENZEL: And I guess the question is I have to say I'm intrigued when you said, \"Gosh, I just have this like sort of consistent urge to wanna leave work.\" What's that about?\nJOSH: I don't know. I'm good at my job. So it's not about that. I guess it's just, I just get anxious sitting there. My work is a very complicated situation where my grandmother owns the company, she's out of town most of the time, and then there's her employees and me. And I'm not like a manager or anything. I can't tell anybody what to do. But usually what I say gets done.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So I have like usually I'm in a pretty good mood there. But even like I feel like once I get all my stuff done that I have other stuff to do. Even if I don't, I just wanna relax when I've finished all my things. Or I mean even if like I mean I guess you could relate it back to like what the problem was with just the urgency to leave. I feel like if I left work early, I could go home and get that thing done that I've been avoiding doing all week. And there's certainly something like that going on right now like this week I have something that I need to get done that has to be turned in by next week for financial aid reasons. And that's due. But I'll probably avoid doing it today by going to the gym. Going to the gym's good but I still need to get this other thing done.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: So I feel like if I leave work, I'll get something done. And I can't leave work, I've been enabled to leave work, they say, \"You're part time. Dude, you have to go home.\" And it's my family's company. So if I have to go home I just go home.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: But I still have to ask permission and everything.\nAMY WENZEL: So I guess what I'm hearing I think is that this urge to leave work is more associated with discomfort associated with the avoidance, I guess of things. Okay. So when you said work is complicated, the first thing that had jumped into my mind is like, \"Boy, should we spend some time talking about this and sorting it out?\" But it sounds like it's more about the avoidance, isn't it?\nJOSH: Yes, it's the more the avoidance.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: I spent years in therapy about my work.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Okay. And so the objectively we would know that you have met that goal by what? How would we know that?\nJOSH: Graduation.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So graduation. Sure. Attending all classes?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I haven't missed any yet.\nAMY WENZEL: Good for you.\nJOSH: I left one early, halfway early so far this semester.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So staying in your classes as well.\nJOSH: Yeah, staying in the classes.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Completing the financial aid form?\nJOSH: Yeah, completing the financial aid form.\nAMY WENZEL: Any other way we know that you're overcoming avoidance?\nJOSH: Um, write my resume.\nAMY WENZEL: Resume. Okay.\nJOSH: I've been putting that off for a long time.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So. But now I've had some small successes this week with some of the things I've been avoiding doing, like checking my credit report and taking care of stuff like that.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So here are some of my ideas of what we could do, I think, to overcome avoidance. One is certainly we're on the right track here with working with some of these thoughts. Because I have a feeling that some of these thoughts just make things worse for you and make it easier to avoid. Would you agree with that?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: I do wonder also if we behaviorally do some things to help you overcome avoidance. One thing might be working some more of these things into your schedule. Do you think that would be helpful?\nJOSH: What kind of things?\nAMY WENZEL: The financial aid form, the resume, you know?\nJOSH: I mean my schedule is set to do those things. I've got to do lists all over the place.\nAMY WENZEL: So the schedule isn't necessarily the issue.\nJOSH: It's the doing of the schedule.\nAMY WENZEL: The doing. Do you think we need some problem solving a bit?\nJOSH: Like time management?\nJOSH: I feel like I manage my time. Pretty descent.\nAMY WENZEL: Well here's an idea here, you know, one of the things that we do with our clients with anxiety disorders is we work on overcoming avoidance in small steps. So we start with something that's associated with more like mild to moderate anxiety and we work up to the really anxiety provoking things. So say, take a person who has a spider phobia. You might start with them sort of just being in the same room with a spider way across the room and you might kinda work up to them eventually picking up the spider. I wonder if we took that same philosophy with you and we started with the smaller and we worked up to some of the mote daunting items and a step-wise fashion.\nJOSH: I suppose they all just seem more daunting.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Maybe next time,\nJOSH: Sorry.\nAMY WENZEL: That's okay. Next time I would actually suggest that we get all of these different tasks that you've been avoiding on the table and we actually objectively look at how daunting they are.\nJOSH: I got those on a list somewhere too already. I could probably remember it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So overcoming avoidance. I'm gonna put a star here. This sounds like a biggie. What other problems do you wanna work on in here?\n\n\nJOSH: Maybe I feel like I say something and you have a better word for it. It's usually avoidance. Um, I don't know, more energy.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I mean, that was one of the things I marked off. I don't have a problem sleeping or waking up. My sleep schedule's great.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. And low energy is often associated with depression. So would you say mild depression is still an issue for you?\nJOSH: Yeah. Certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, that's what it looked like on your questionnaire.\nJOSH: And then avoidance, I mean I've been avoiding to go pick up my prescription for three weeks.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. So again, one of the ways that we are gonna know that you're overcoming your mild depression, is again sort of the same indicators that you're overcoming avoidance in general. Right? Okay. So like picking up your prescription. Okay. Are there things that you normally enjoy doing or find pleasurable that you haven't been doing because of low energy?\nJOSH: I was in a, I was lead guitar player for a Christian worship band for like four or five years.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh that's terrific.\nJOSH: And I put that down. I've been on a bit of a sabbatical.\nAMY WENZEL: Is that something you wanna do?\nJOSH: Yeah. I love doing it. And playing guitar in general, I haven't been playing guitar for like seven or eight years.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Yeah, so I think in addition to some of this working with the thoughts, I do think starting to identify these activities that you found pleasurable, that you valued, and figuring out how to make them a priority, then we could track their effect on your mood. And my theory is that if you're doing some of these things that you get enjoyment out of, that's gonna be very reinforcing for you and that will actually be energy inducing, rather than energy sapping. And that will kind of help you to get on a new behavioral track. Okay.\nJOSH: Yeah, I've been trying to do that on my own with just by going on a diet. Expecting all these great things to come out of it. You know?\nAMY WENZEL: It sounds like you've been sticking with your diet, right?\nJOSH: Yeah.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. In addition to some of the avoidance, the depression, anything else that you're hoping to get out of this?\nJOSH: Nah, I mean I'm sure there is but nothing that comes to mind.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. Well you have the sheet of paper, it sounds like you're gonna translate that to evernote, so you have it on all of your devices. But you can also write down other things that come to mind that don't necessarily fit this format. So if it's something that you'd like to talk about or address or if it's something that, another issue that you forgot to bring up, just jot it down and then we can put that in the game plan to really talk about next time.\nJOSH: Okay.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So how do you think this went?\nJOSH: I think it went well.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I imagined a smaller room. And I don't know. I guess that's it. Did you pick out all the things yourself?\nAMY WENZEL: I did not pick out the things myself. They were here. When you said that you imagined a smaller room, is the bigger room kind of daunting for you?\nJOSH: No, cause the lights kinda seal it off.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I have played guitar on a stage where you couldn't see past the stage so I guess it's kind of like that except nobody's out there.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, except for nobody's out there. Okay. Did you learn anything today?\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean I'm not gonna remember your model.\nAMY WENZEL: No.\nJOSH: But it's gonna change the way I think.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: I think I read a lot of self help books. Malcolm Gladdis Willis probably used this before.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Is he a bad one? Should I not be reading him?\nAMY WENZEL: No, I like his writing a lot, actually. Very insightful about human nature, human experience.\nJOSH: Yeah, I love his books.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. Sure. And it shows that you're an inquisitive person. I mean it shows that you really strive for self understanding.\nJOSH: Yeah. He's definitely got it down pat.\nAMY WENZEL: Well we'll make sure that we have this model again so it can reinforce what we've learned and we can take what you have on the sheet and really apply it to this way of understanding.\nJOSH: Okay.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Is there anything that you thought that I didn't understand or that I got wrong?\nJOSH: Um, no. I mean, probably not.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

You're looking very dressed up today.\nJOSH: Oh yeah. Thank you. I tend to fluctuate a little bit.\nAMY WENZEL: Tend to fluctuate a little bit. Hey, I appreciate it that you emailed me this homework.\nJOSH: Um yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah yeah.\nJOSH: Got it in time?\nAMY WENZEL: I got it in time, we were able to print it out here. So I'd love to be able to go over that with you.\nJOSH: Oh, sure. Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, you know another thing that I always do that I'm gonna be doing at the beginning of these sessions each time is just checking with you regarding your questionnaire scores so, the first questionnaire that you had responded to was one that was assessing depressive symptoms. And then the second one was assessing symptoms of anxiety. And if I'm not mistaken, your scores on both of them decreased just a little bit from last time to this time.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Did you have that sense?\nJOSH: Maybe, yeah. It's been a good two weeks, I suppose.\nAMY WENZEL: Good two weeks.\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean.\nAMY WENZEL: Is that something we should talk about what made the past two weeks good, so we can see what we can grab from that and really continue to apply to your life?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so I'll write that down. We can definitely review the homework, we can talk about what was good in the past couple weeks. What else did you wanna make sure that we accomplish here today?\nJOSH: Um, I suppose that's it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. I remember last time as well we were talking about the different types of things, the tasks that you avoid and we were talking about maybe creating a list and looking at ones that would be a little easier than others. You said you had a to do list that you were gonna bring in here.\nJOSH: Oh I completely forgot about the to do list.\nAMY WENZEL: Forgot about the to do list.\nJOSH: I mean, it would be hard to find just one. I have notes everywhere of things I have to do. And different names for lists and things like that.\nAMY WENZEL: Well what do you think about this? What if we review the homework and talk about what was good and ways to continue what was good. Maybe we can do a little bit of a recreation of the to do list and we could really take a look at rating just how difficult and anxiety provoking these different things are and start to organize them so we can start to tackle them and overcome avoidance.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Does that sound okay?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So nothing else that you wanted to cover?\nJOSH: Um, I mean, I figure we'll probably talk about something and I'll think of something then.\nAMY WENZEL: If you do think of something, just feel free to bring that up. Okay.\nJOSH: Yeah. That's fine.\nAMY WENZEL: Another question that I always ask at the beginning is, \"Well, it's just a little bit of reflection on the previous visit.\" So now that we've had a couple weeks since we first met each other, any thoughts about what we've done so far?\nJOSH: Um, I mean we just go over these things and the concepts, the definitions and it makes sense when you tell them in person. But I think about them as the time goes on. So you notice the definitions taking out.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. Was there one particular example?\nJOSH: I mean it's just while you're doing something like avoidance it's just, you know you're doing it. And sometimes it makes it a lot worse. But at least you know you're doing it and then you can acknowledge the problem.\nAMY WENZEL: You can acknowledge. So it sounds like you really have an increased recognition or awareness of some of these patterns when they've come up in your life.\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I don't know. I guess just naming some things sometimes makes it, when you name something like automatic thought.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: It's not as discouraging.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, good. Good. A lot of my clients find that if there are names for some of these cognitive processes or behavioral processes they find themselves doing, it just gives them a sense of normalcy that these are real concepts that have definitions and that other people experience. And it helps to show them that they're not the only ones who struggle with it.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So you had that sense as well?\nJOSH: I mean I suppose that's true.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I don't know. I just like the definitions. I guess I know that people, other people struggle with it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So just for you, just having I guess almost like a code word kind of so that you can really conceptualize what was happening.\nJOSH: Yeah, I can frame it out.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, I like that. Okay. So of the homework and the good couple of weeks here, which one would you like to start with first?\nJOSH: Um, we could start with the homework.\nAMY WENZEL: The homework? Okay.\nJOSH: We could go to what was good or bad.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. So it sounds like there were five different times that you noticed some automatic thoughts. Is that right?\nJOSH: I probably had more that I could talk about. But those are like definitely the five that stick out in my mind.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. And this first one I'm noticing, the situation is urged to leave work.\nJOSH: Yeah, that's the one we started last week.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So that was the one that was the model. So then the second one here, you were planning on spending some money on concert tickets?\nJOSH: I did spend money on concert tickets.\nAMY WENZEL: You did spend money on concert tickets.\nJOSH: Boy was it stressful.\nAMY WENZEL: What is this in parentheses?\nJOSH: That's just I thought you might ask me about it so I bought tickets for a festival called \"Bona Roo.\" My girlfriend and I wanted to go on a cruise together until we realized that we can't afford it. So we decided to go, we'd just pick a big concert that we could drive to, have a little vacation in the summer.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, good for you.\nJOSH: We didn't get each other anything for Christmas until we bought each other tickets, we put the money aside. But then when I went to go spend the money, it was like still, I don't know, stressful.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. And so it sounds like your automatic thought is, \"I'll go broke.\" Or...\nJOSH: Yeah, like something bad'll happen like...\nAMY WENZEL: Something bad will happen. I'm gonna write that down because that sounds to me like the underlying theme there, right? Something bad will happen.\nJOSH: I mean, car problems or anything.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But it's not like I don't have any money it's just I don't wanna spend any of the money. I'm trying to save money. For some reason like it's always been drilled in my head.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure, sure.\nJOSH: So.\nAMY WENZEL: And it sounds like, so the bottom line is you have the belief that if you spend money then something's gonna come up.\nJOSH: Not only that but the spending of the money was very difficult. The website, cause everybody logs on at noon on the same day and tries to buy tickets. So you're just clocking reload and reload and we ended up getting like more expensive tickets because of it.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh okay, because the more inexpensive ones were getting snatched up?\nJOSH: Yeah, they only had 20,000 of those and 25 of the other ones. But I mean it was only like 40 dollars more than what we planned on spending anyway.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: It's all good.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Yeah. You know what kinda strikes me is, we were talking about avoidance and procrastination last time and it kinda sounds like this is something that you couldn't avoid because if you wanted the tickets you had to be on there at a certain time.\nJOSH: Yeah. In fact, if anything I avoided the early early bird three or four months ago. But the more I avoided the more expensive it is. So I guess if you had to put that in a graph, that actively doing something will happen once it gets more expensive than I'm willing to pay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Okay. So basically the bottom line is, \"I'm gonna go broke,\" or something bad's gonna happen and there is a lot of fear there.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. On a scale of zero to ten, how much fear?\nJOSH: Of losing everything I have?\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. How much fear is associated with that automatic thought?\nJOSH: Probably like 100.\nAMY WENZEL: 100. Okay.\nJOSH: And I'm not, I don't know. I guess like worst case scenario if I lost all my money, everything I own, like my family's not an impoverished family. I would probably be okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I would have opportunities to work, I'm comfortable making the money back. It's just probably an irrational fear.\nAMY WENZEL: You know what? I'm glad that you brought that up because what you automatically started doing was looking at the other side of the coin, saying, \"Well my family isn't impoverished. And there are other ways to make money.\" Let me ask you that; when you focus on those alternatives, what is the amount of fear go down to?\nJOSH: I mean it's less but it's still there.\nAMY WENZEL: Still there.\nJOSH: I don't wanna do all those things.\nAMY WENZEL: You don't wanna do...\nJOSH: I don't wanna ask my family for money ever.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely. Absolutely. And I understand, a lot of people don't wanna ask their family for money. But are you still at 100?\nJOSH: Maybe less so. I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: Could you give it a number?\nJOSH: I think 85.\nAMY WENZEL: 85. Okay.\nJOSH: It's definitely less intimidating.\nAMY WENZEL: Less intimidating.\nJOSH: You feel like you have support and like your skills, your hire-ability.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. You know you just did what I'm hoping to teach you through this process is that once you recognize the automatic thought, we want you to really start to question it and just say, \"Hey, you know, is this 100 percent accurate? Or are there some things I'm forgetting to acknowledge?\" And you readily were able to say, \"Okay, wait a minute. My family is not impoverished. I could do some extra things to earn money. I don't wanna ask for money. I don't wanna put forth this extra effort.\" So it doesn't make you feel especially good but it brings down that level of fear a bit, right?\nJOSH: Yeah, certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah.\nJOSH: The thought process.\n\n\nAMY WENZEL: That is, that's what we're trying to do here, that's what we're trying to do here. Okay, okay. So here's a second situation. Looks like you were out at a bar?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: With your girlfriend or friends?\nJOSH: Girlfriend and her dad and her dad's girlfriend.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So you know you put in parentheses it was a social situation.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And your automatic thought is you won't be able to hold the conversation and you won't be able to avoid coming off as grumpy.\nJOSH: It's just hard to hang out with my, I wanna have a good relationship with them. So I mean, they're all very, I don't know, affluent people.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. You know, just out of curiosity, some of my other clients I worked with who had some struggle that was social anxiety, the bottom line was their automatic thoughts were worries about being judged negatively. Do you think that was going on here?\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: That's just.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you know what I've done here with both of these examples is see how I kinda put an arrow? And these arrows are kind of pointing at the meaning that underlies the automatic thoughts. And oftentimes the meaning is sort of the fundamental issue or the bottom line that's really most associated with the negative emotional reaction.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Would you say, \"I will be judged negatively,\" do you think that was the bottom line in this situation?\nJOSH: I mean sure, yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. And you were anxious and depressed. How anxious were you on our ten point scale?\nJOSH: I mean I was drinking more than I probably would've been.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Gotcha. So the anxiety was high and then the drinking did what?\nJOSH: I don't know. Make me forget that I didn't wanna be there, I suppose. It was a karaoke bar too. Did I mention that?\nAMY WENZEL: You did not mention that.\nJOSH: They really want you to sing. So that's like the anxiety too.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Did you sing?\nJOSH: No.\nAMY WENZEL: No. No. Did you have another automatic thought like, \"If I sing I'll sound silly?\"\nJOSH: Um, yeah, probably.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Or maybe, \"I'll stick out like a sore thumb if I don't sing?\"\nJOSH: I mean no, I wasn't worried about that.\nAMY WENZEL: You weren't worried about that. Okay so more what would happen if you did sing.\nJOSH: It was just like, I mean we were at a different bar before that. And then we ended up staying there for like way too long.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. You know just out of curiosity, was there any indication that your girlfriend's father and his girlfriend were judging you negatively?\nJOSH: No.\nAMY WENZEL: No.\nJOSH: But she really respects her opinion so much. They're the kind of people who just come out and say something like that, you know. There'd be a comment the next morning.\nAMY WENZEL: A comment the next morning. And to your knowledge, were there any comments the next morning?\nJOSH: I left first thing next morning. I had a full work that day to do.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Am I also catching there that there's a bit of concern that if they judge you negatively they somehow might influence your girlfriend?\nJOSH: No, I think I just want them to like me. Cause I like my girlfriend a lot, It's pretty serious.\nAMY WENZEL: So maybe like, \"They won't like me.\"\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I hope he likes me.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you know we talked about the anxiety being high and then drinking was like an escape or took the edge off. What about depressed? How depressed on a zero to ten scale?\nJOSH: I mean I don't know. I just, I didn't like, I could hold a conversation with those people. But then I just feel bad about myself. I could probably talk about music and guitar with her dad for a long time.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. Sure.\nJOSH: I don't know. I just, I don't know, you just don't think about what you could do, you're just kinda feeling bad about yourself. So.\nAMY WENZEL: So put words into feeling badly about yourself. What?\nJOSH: I wish I could sing, I guess. I wish I was more charismatic.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So, \"I can't sing well. I'm not charismatic.\"\nJOSH: I can sing well.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh you can sing well.\nJOSH: I just can't sing well in front of people.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, in front of people. Okay. Wow, so this situation's really interesting to me because it seems like you've actually came, there's a whole bunch of automatic thoughts. So there's automatic thoughts about just how you are portraying yourself. There's automatic thoughts about your girlfriend's father and his girlfriend judging you negatively. And then it sounds like there's also sort of some negative automatic thoughts like almost self-deprecating, like judging yourself negatively.\nJOSH: Yeah, a little bit, like you know, that one came after the ones but sure.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. Yeah this is a great example because I think people oftentimes experience a bunch of different thoughts and they're inter-related and yet they're separate enough that they can all really be evaluated and really sort of softened if it's determined that they might be a little bit overstated. So you can actually write all of them, you know, on this particular type of sheet. You know what I mean? So we can really make sure that we have covered the full scope.\nJOSH: I'm not too keen on the paperwork sometimes. So maybe you could tell, it looks like I only wrote down five. But, like all those situations I guess were more than one thing.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah sure. Is that something we should probably talk about as well as maybe an alternative to the paperwork?\nJOSH: Um, I mean, I guess, yeah.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

So, here's an academic one. So you were starting a paper and it was pretty close to the deadline. \"I'm gonna fail this class.\" Definitely a threatening thought.\nJOSH: That one, I succeeded and I felt really good about myself. And that makes it a good week.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah.\nJOSH: So I did everything. I mean that was like, I don't know, it was a class I was having a hard time with.\nAMY WENZEL: Really?\nJOSH: I mean it's an online class. I don't think anybody with anxiety should take online classes.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Is this the one for which you didn't do the quiz?\nJOSH: Yeah. Perhaps.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: That was a different class.\nAMY WENZEL: A different class.\nJOSH: That class I'm doing okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So you had a very definite prediction, \"I'm gonna fail this class.\"\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: You had anxiety. On a zero to ten, how much anxiety?\nJOSH: Um, I mean if I fail my class I don't graduate so probably like 100.\nAMY WENZEL: That's one other 100. Off the charts. Off the charts. Um, so how, at times these automatic thoughts seem to paralyze you.\nJOSH: Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: And kinda keep you from taking action. So what helped you to get over that hump and?\nJOSH: I mean, caffeine. Just like, I don't know. Eventually the anxiety builds so I've been putting that off for probably two weeks. It only took me like three hours to do.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: It wasn't a long paper at all.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: It was just one of those assignments the teacher gives you at the beginning, this will be due. If she would've given it to me like a week before it was due, probably a lot less anxiety.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. We talked about...\nJOSH: Instead I had all the time to do it and I just didn't do it.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. So it got to this crisis point almost. \"I'm going to fail this class.\" But then you drank some coffee? Drank some soda?\nJOSH: Yeah. No, I don't drink soda.\nAMY WENZEL: You dont drink soda. Drink some coffee. Okay. Okay. You know, how did you, how did you not let this idea, \"I'm gonna fail this class,\" how did you not let it just paralyze you?\nJOSH: I mean I guess it did. I just eventually had to do it. I failed classes doing that before so it's either do it or you don't.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Did you think back to the times that you failed classes because you didn't do it? And said, \"Okay, this time's gonna be different.\"\nJOSH: I mean, yeah, that was like my thought process, like going to the semester. Cause I am gonna graduate college this semester. I have to get it done. There's no other semesters to do the work.\nAMY WENZEL: Exactly, You had said last time, I remember, \"Do or die.\" That's the way you described this semester. Okay. Okay. So there's no choice, you had to do it. And, what? You did well. Right?\nJOSH: Yeah, I think so.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I think I'm really good at writing papers.\nAMY WENZEL: You got that done. Alright. I just wonder how you can remember this experience for the future so you have this positive evidence that you really can?\nJOSH: I mean I guess I'm gonna try and build on my positive things a little bit at a time. Like a ladder. But I don't know how.\n\nAMY WENZEL: I have an idea actually. This is paperwork so bare with me for a second because we might be able to translate this into something different than paperwork. Would you mind grabbing the clipboard? I would like you to title this \"Success Log.\" Okay?\n[sil.]\nAMY WENZEL: And make a little bullet point so this is the first in our series. And in your own words, could you log down the fact that you thought you were gonna fail class because you procrastinated this paper and you were able to do it and do it well. So whatever words you wanna use for that.\nJOSH: I guess it would just be successfully completing paper.\nAMY WENZEL: Maybe write the name of the class down.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\n[sil.]\nAMY WENZEL: Why do you think I'm having you do this?\nJOSH: Um, because you know I don't like writing? As you can see I made that only five words. I didn't really capture the emotion in the statement too.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Well you certainly captured the important points there. So.\nJOSH: I believe when you write something you remember it well.\nAMY WENZEL: Honestly I believe that as well. As a student you probably know that when you have an exam coming up, what gives you a better chance of doing well on the exam? Kind of kicking back and passively reading the textbook? Or taking notes and underlining?\nJOSH: Writing note-cards I never read.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Writing note-cards you never read. Even actively writing note-cards though, I bet you, it sticks into your mind.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So I'm not trying to punish you by developing this list. But I think you are starting to see kind of this act of writing burns this into your mind and you're gonna remember this experience.\nJOSH: It just seems backwards to me. Cause I should write down the things I need to do, not the things I've already done.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. Here's my theory; so and this is interesting because you're talking about backwards again. Remember you wanted the arrows to go the different way?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And so this is actually an example of the arrows going a different way. I would love for us to come up with some sort of mechanism where you write down all of these experiences where you have success, especially the experiences where you thought you were gonna fail but yet they ended up going well. And my idea is that over time as you accumulate these bullet points, you're gonna have evidence after evidence, data after data to support the idea that you can be successful, that you're not failing. And that is that arrow going right the other direction. You know, where instead of having a failure core belief, we're gonna have, we're gonna really form a new core belief. You know maybe, \"I'm successful.\" Or, \"I'm just as successful as the next person.\" Do you buy that?\nJOSH: Yeah. I think that's good writing down the accomplishments and such.\n\n\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Another trick is how do we do this in a way that works for your style? Because you don't really like the written paperwork.\nJOSH: I don't know. Cause if it's not written down I probably wouldn't read it. I could hide anything digitally. When I read something on my computer it's gone.\nAMY WENZEL: Really? Really? Cause you had mentioned Evernote last time.\nJOSH: Oh yeah, Evernote's different. Evernote saves everything.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. What would it be like to start an Evernote file that is available on all of your devices? And call it \"Success Log.\"\nJOSH: It'd have to be a note. Yeah I could do that.\nAMY WENZEL: Is there something about it being a note?\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. My experience with Evernote is that when you make a note like that, the more you, whenever you add to it, it's at the top, at least if you have the file by the date and time and whatnot. And I wonder if having it right there at the top when you open up Evernote, would then kind of cue you and remind you to read the list?\nJOSH: Yeah, no, that would definitely work.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So we can even do this together, if you have your phone right now. We could put it in Evernote.\nJOSH: Um, my phone's shut off.\nAMY WENZEL: Your phone is shut off. Okay. That's probably good. So the phone is not ringing in the middle of the session. Would this be something that you'd be willing to do even maybe before you go to bed?\nJOSH: I could make a note in class today. That would make me avoid being in class.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. So.\nJOSH: I almost started to decide to leave early from class today.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. Since that was a pattern we had talked about before, do you think we should put that on our game-plan to talk about also?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Okay. Okay. So we have this \"Success Log.\" Is there anything else, since it's right in front of you right here, that we should also put down that you can think of right off the top of your head?\nJOSH: Things that I've done successfully?\nAMY WENZEL: Yes. Especially things...\nJOSH: I had two exams go well.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Write that down. Write what classes those were.\n[sil.]\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Anything else you can think to put on there?\nJOSH: Um, I don't know. It's probably, I don't usually focus on those kinds of things, I suppose.\nAMY WENZEL: It seems pretty foreign for you, right?\nJOSH: Usually it's a relief to have finally done it. Not like an accomplishment or feeling good because I accomplished that. It's like oof, it's over.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. And again, I wonder if, cause right now sort of this failure core belief is still more salient for you than the successful core belief. So my idea is that by keeping the success log over time, every time you add to it it's like taking one step up a mountain and over time those steps accumulate, where you're gonna start to believe the successful core belief more and more.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: With more and more evidence. I once had a client do a success log and he had 130 items on it. You could not argue with 130 bullet points of all the different things that he had accomplished.\nJOSH: As long as you're not keeping a failure log, I suppose. We're not keeping a failure log. We're keeping a success long. Remember we're making, I loved what you said before, making the arrows go in the opposite direction. So rather than reinforcing the \"I'm a failure,\" we're gonna create the, \"I'm successful.\"\nAMY WENZEL: That makes sense.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. What's your confidence level that this will be helpful for you?\nAMY WENZEL: I mean I think it'll be helpful. It just sounds kinda like, I used to keep a journal and I felt like I tried to write down good things in that too but I never did it anymore. But maybe if I make a commitment to you to do it, it'll be more successful.\nJOSH: That can help. That can help. I think the other thing too is sometimes when people talk about journaling, it's sort of free form and sometimes people don't exactly know what to write. And so this gives you some structure. This is just a bullet point with a few words. And you're good at choosing the important words. So, it doesn't take a long description.\nAMY WENZEL: No, not at all.\nJOSH: Yeah. So it sounds like you're confident that it can be helpful, that we're making the arrows go in the other direction.\nAMY WENZEL: I think it'll help.\n\nJOSH: Okay. Okay. Can I ask you, what did you conclude from doing this, other than the fact that you don't like paperwork?\nAMY WENZEL: Um, I concluded that I don't know. I mean it definitely helped. It just made me more aware of I had to like, just being aware, like the awareness and the formatted even in my head.\nJOSH: Okay, okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Even if I only wrote it down a couple times. Like I was probably, I was categorizing those things in my head like every day.\nJOSH: Okay and so you were actually recognizing some of the thoughts that were getting you into trouble.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah.\nJOSH: Okay. Do you buy the fact that there's a relationship between some of the things that you're saying to yourself and how you're feeling, particularly with the anxiety?\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. I mean one of the things on the homework form was about just like slowing down the thoughts. So I guess I just sometimes like think too fast.\nJOSH: Right. And that's a hallmark feature of anxiety actually. I actually call it the runaway train where you have a thought like, \"Gosh I'm gonna be late for my exam.\" And then you have the next thought of, \"Oh, my professor's gonna be disappointed in me.\" And then you have the next thought, \"Well then I'm gonna fail the class and then I'm not gonna graduate and then I'm not gonna do this and that.\" So you're absolutely right, that slowing down and having that recognition or awareness is absolutely key in working with these anxious thoughts.\nAMY WENZEL: So, you look like you have something on your mind.\nJOSH: No no no. I'm fine.\nAMY WENZEL: You're contemplating.\nJOSH: Yeah. I think it's good.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. Now help me out here. One of the things that I had prepared for today is another step in this process of actually working with these automatic thoughts. I didn't anticipate that we would develop this success log. So I'm kinda curious whether we should just focus on the success log for now and hold off on some of the stuff that I had prepared, or should I give it to you and see what you wanna do with it?\nJOSH: You can give it to me. And if I don't start until next week.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, alright, we'll see what you think. So this is a list of something that I call thinking traps. And thinking traps are just ways of not only understanding our automatic thoughts and recognizing sort of our pattern of thinking, but they're also a cue to really put the breaks on and say, \"Oh boy. Am I falling into a trap here? Might I be making some sort of a thinking error? Or is this thinking really accurate and helpful?\" So I see you kind of scanning that list and looking at it. Just take a couple moments to look over that and tell me if any of these thinking patterns, these traps, really characterize you or some of your own patterns?\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean, this could just be like a list of reactions for me. So. Jumping to conclusions. Disqualifying the positive. Over-generalization.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: Personalization. Another one.\nAMY WENZEL: Another one and this is why I hesitated.\nJOSH: We have four columns in this one.\nAMY WENZEL: We have four columns in that one, exactly. Exactly. Because what I typically do with my own clients is once they've gotten good like you at identifying these automatic thoughts, I have them start to recognize whether they're falling into one or more of these traps. Like I said, sort of as as first step in saying, \"Wait a minute, let's put on the breaks. Let's take a look at what's happening. Am I falling into a trap?\"\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So on the one hand just your initial reaction to these, it sounds like many of these resonate with you. Is that correct?\nJOSH: True, yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. On the other hand it's more writing. So.\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean it's gonna be easy to implement into Evernote cause it's only one more column.\nAMY WENZEL: Only one more column. And did you do this one in Evernote too?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, terrific.\nJOSH: But I was happy to copy and paste it right cause I was worried it wouldn't.\nAMY WENZEL: The cutting and pasting work perfectly. They work perfectly. Okay. So since you already did the work to set this up in Evernote, would you like to give it a try?\nJOSH: Yeah, I can't promise much. I'm already working on the successful log.\nAMY WENZEL: I would agree. And there's always a danger in having too much homework. So what if we were to do this? Here's my idea; success log first priority. How is that?\nJOSH: Um yeah that's good.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay so that's a first priority. You know the second is I can actually now that you and I have exchanged emails, I can actually cut and paste this and put it in an email. So then you could actually have these definitions, maybe underneath this in Evernote so you can consult it.\nJOSH: That sounds a lot easier.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: You'd even just attach it.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

It does seem to me like that's, that you're right, that it's imminent and it's really indicative of exactly what we talked about last time.\nJOSH: True.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah.\nJOSH: It's a whole situation summed up.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So in a nutshell, what's behind that urge to leave class early tonight?\nJOSH: I just, the failing last week I suppose, with the exam.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, and you for sure failed the exam?\nJOSH: Um, I'm not sure if I failed the exam with the curve but I'm pretty close and that's just uncomfortable for me. Especially like (inaudible ).\nAMY WENZEL: I'm going to link this back to your thinking trap. Well first you're like, \"Yeah, I failed.\" And that seems like a pretty definite all or nothing statement. But even when I just asked like, \"Did you really fail for sure?\"\nJOSH: Most people in the class didn't do well.\nAMY WENZEL: Didn't do well.\nJOSH: It's hard to tell what she'll do.\nAMY WENZEL: It's hard to tell what she'll do.\nJOSH: It's gonna be an interesting class in the beginning, that's why I want to go for the beginning and not the end because I just wanna see what she does. Everybody I've talked to is pretty upset.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So there's no question, I mean, it's not a great situation. But you haven't failed yet and you don't have evidence you failed yet. So you're somewhere a little bit in the middle, even if you're closer to the negative side.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Is that correct?\nJOSH: No. As my friend Will said, it's pretty recoverable.\nAMY WENZEL: It's pretty recoverable.\nJOSH: He said, \"I didn't do well either but it's recoverable.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Recoverable. Okay. Okay. When you say to yourself in these all or nothing terms, \"I'm failing this class,\" or \"I failed last week,\" does that increase the likelihood or decrease the likelihood that you'll go to class?\nJOSH: Oh it decreases the likelihood.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Okay. And then if you say to yourself, like \"Eh, it's not great. I don't know that I failed. Will says it's recoverable. Everybody's kinda struggling.\" Does that make it more likely that you'll actually go?\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean from that perspective it sounds better. But I never think that way so.\nAMY WENZEL: But that's what I'm trying to help you do.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And you know what? With the idea of the financial situation on your homework, you were able to do that yourself. You were able to say, \"Even though I don't wanna borrow money or I don't wanna ask for money, I don't wanna work these extra hours, I could do that if I needed money.\" And this is kind of the same thing here. Like it's an uncomfortable situation but there's a little bit more to it than having just failed last week and ending the semester now.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah, I guess they're kinda comparable.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. So yeah the flexible thinking. The other thing that strikes me about this particular situation is it gives you an opportunity to just tolerate being uncomfortable and tolerate kind of being on that edge.\nJOSH: Yeah?\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Nobody likes it but challenges and disappointments are inevitable in life right?\nJOSH: Not enough coffee in the world.\nAMY WENZEL: Not enough coffee in the world. Exactly. Exactly. So could you see this almost like, sure, a training ground, almost, for coping with other uncomfortable situations in the future?\nJOSH: Yeah. Perhaps.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Desirable difficulty.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, a desirable difficulty.\nJOSH: What I learned the past two weeks.\nAMY WENZEL: I'm gonna write that down? I like that.\nJOSH: It's (inaudible ) just to warn you.\nAMY WENZEL: One of your favorite authors. Right, right. So if you were to say that to yourself and you were to go to class, would that actually also be something for the success log, that you were able to overcome this pretty intense urge not to go to class and you went and you tolerated the discomfort.\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean sometimes yeah it's just like the reason I go to college anymore is just cause I did well a couple years ago. It's been a couple years now but that's the way I think about when I say I have to keep going to school.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: If I used to do it, I could probably do it again.\nAMY WENZEL: There you go. There you go. That's something.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So this more, I guess, nuanced or balanced way of viewing your classes is increasing the likelihood that you'll actually go.\nJOSH: Yeah. Define the newest way of looking.\nAMY WENZEL: The newest way of looking is that I think number one is the opportunity to tolerate discomfort or practice tolerating discomfort. Which you'll need in the future.\n[sil.]\nJOSH: Reasons to go to school. Or go to this particular class.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. Um, and I think we said number two is you actually don't know that you failed. So even though you're not feeling great about your performance in the class, it's at this moment overstating it to conclude that you failed.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right?\nJOSH: Yeah it is.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And then do you wanna write down Will's famous last words, \"It's recoverable.\" Okay.\nJOSH: He'll never know that we're talking about him.\nAMY WENZEL: And then I think number four, and this is something I said, so you tell me if this resonates with you; a lot of people are struggling there. So you know there is comradery. I even wonder, back when I was a university professor, students in my class were struggling, and that was actually an indication to me that I needed to do something a little bit different. So I gave some opportunities, at least for some tutoring, even if I wasn't gonna necessarily change my grading scheme. So might it be possible that everybody, because so many people are struggling, that there'll be some adjustments like that?\nJOSH: I can hope. That's what happened with one of my other tests that went well.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: In a different class, I got an 82 percent. And it was the third best grade in the class. But it was, I thought I got an A.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I guess I swallowed that one, that one went well.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: But I didn't know that until after I got there.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: Got to the class. And nobody else did that well.\nAMY WENZEL: Nobody else did that well. Okay.\nJOSH: One person got an A.\nAMY WENZEL: One person got an A. Okay.\nJOSH: And that was a law class so it was...\nAMY WENZEL: Honestly that sounds like some success log material for me as well, the fact that you got the third highest score in the class.\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean that was like something good that happened in the past two weeks.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

So at least there is precedence at Governor State University that when a lot of people don't do well, the instructor takes a step back and evaluates things. Okay.\nJOSH: But I mean I guess the difference in that, I got to see the results, the average, before I got to go in there.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, so you actually saw the average before you got to go in there.\nJOSH: Before I got to go into that class. So it was a little easier to go into.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: And I felt a lot better about that exam.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. Well you know what I think that you're demonstrating here? Is a hallmark feature of a lot of people's anxiety and that's like that you don't really like uncertainty.\nJOSH: No.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah and most of us don't like uncertainty. But and again, almost the only thing that's certain in life is that there's going to be uncertainty.\nJOSH: Nice.\nAMY WENZEL: I know. I know. Cold fact.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So again like I was saying this is an exercise in learning how to tolerate being a bit uncomfortable but it's also similarly an exercise in learning to cope with uncertainty.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. So when you look at that list of four things there together, how confident now are you that you're gonna go to class?\nJOSH: I'm gonna go to class. It's the leaving of it early.\nAMY WENZEL: The leaving.\nJOSH: That'll be in question.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay so you're 100 percent confident that you're gonna go.\nJOSH: I'm here already, that's why I'm gonna go.\nAMY WENZEL: You're here already.\nJOSH: It would be a waste of money if I didn't go.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So you're going. How confident are you that you're gonna stay?\nJOSH: I'd say a 50/50.\nAMY WENZEL: 50/50.\nJOSH: See if Will's there.\nAMY WENZEL: Will's there. Maybe Will can impart some words of wisdom, right?\nJOSH: Yeah, he was talking about not going at all.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So before we started this, were you even lower than 50/50? Maybe only like 25?\nJOSH: I was probably like 25 percent I wasn't gonna go, I mean more than that, I mean 90 percent sure I wasn't gonna go. 75 percent sure that I wasn't gonna go. 25 percent sure that I wasn't gonna stay.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So we're up to 50/50. I guess, what would the consequences be if you left? Would there be negative consequences?\nJOSH: Um, the professor would probably be looking at me.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But I mean, it's a fairly large class.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. We kinda dealt with that one, that idea a little bit even last time, that. Yeah. You know, can I share something that's running through my mind?\nJOSH: Sure.\nAMY WENZEL: You know I wonder if you were to leave that you might miss out on an opportunity either to learn the information that would help to put this in perspective.\nJOSH: That's the frustrating thing about it, is that the test, it turns out, is based completely off of a set of quizzes and the book. Nothing I lecture that was really tested on. So it was just, it really takes the value of going to lecture down real low. Especially when a couple semesters ago she could barely speak English. So it's just been real hard.\nAMY WENZEL: That sounds tough. It sounds tough. What would be the psychological consequences on yourself if you were to leave?\nJOSH: It just makes it easier to leave early next time.\nAMY WENZEL: That's exactly what you said.\nJOSH: Which is why this happened already.\nAMY WENZEL: Exactly. Exactly. Yeah and what's our main goal in our work together?\nJOSH: Defeat anxiety and finish college, I suppose.\nAMY WENZEL: Defeat anxiety, finish college and remember the avoidance. We talked about the avoidance a lot last time. So I actually wrote down as a number one treatment goal to overcome avoidance.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So wouldn't it be great if you stayed in class, reminding yourself of these reasons and you took a step towards overcoming avoidance?\nJOSH: That'd be great. It's be better if she showed the class out early tonight.\nAMY WENZEL: Well you can only stay right, to know if she's gonna do that.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: How about this? Would there be something that you could reward yourself with after? For staying through a grueling class that you don't want to?\nJOSH: No, I'm on a no carb diet. There's no room for ice cream or anything.\nAMY WENZEL: No room for ice cream. It doesn't have to be even something bad. Like for example, could you take a night off from worrying about studying and just relax with your girlfriend?\nJOSH: Nope.\nAMY WENZEL: How come?\nJOSH: I don't really live with my girlfriend. I don't see her during the week.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh you don't see her during the week. Okay, okay. So the condo, that's something for later.\nJOSH: Yeah. We're looking to buy one.\nJOSH: Yeah, I could.\nAMY WENZEL: Something where you could just for a night, take the pressure off of yourself to study or do the stuff and just enjoy as a reward for sticking it out?\nJOSH: Yeah, and I'm thinking about going to Chicago after class.\nAMY WENZEL: Ah, okay. Okay.\nJOSH: I drive in a 45 minute triangle to the girlfriend, school and home.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. How about this? You only let yourself go to Chicago if you stay the full class.\nJOSH: Yeah, that would have to be the deal there.\nAMY WENZEL: Is it a deal?\nJOSH: I don't know. I don't even know if I have time to go to Chicago tonight. I still have class tomorrow. I'll probably think about that during class though.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. Or again, use this concept of the reward. So if you decide that Chicago's too much, is there something just little that you could, like I said, take the pressure off of yourself, relax or something as a treat that you wouldn't have normally given yourself?\nJOSH: Yeah, I don't know. I guess I usually treat myself with food. Which is why I'm on a diet.\nAMY WENZEL: You're on a diet. You're doing a good job with that diet. We don't wanna break that.\nJOSH: Yeah. No.\nAMY WENZEL: So could you just write down reward with a question mark so you don't forget? So you can focus on that in class. So we're about out of time here. So tell me what you're gonna do for homework.\nJOSH: I am going to successful log first. And I'm gonna add a column to the chart.\nAMY WENZEL: Yep.\nJOSH: And then you're gonna email me these so I could...\nAMY WENZEL: You got it.\nJOSH: So and I'll try not to avoid class too much.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. That's a terrific summary. So what'd you learn here today?\nJOSH: Um, I mean I guess I just learned that I could do better, I guess if I stopped avoiding things, defining things.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: And actually writing down my successes and not just all my failures down.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, it's interesting, the language that you're choosing to answer that question is interesting because you're almost disqualifying what you're doing. You're doing a big deal by coming in here, you did your homework, you absolutely did your homework. You know you're doing a success log. You're at least considering staying in class when you wouldn't before. So yeah, give yourself some credit. You're trying.\nJOSH: Yeah. I've been really trying to improve myself the past couple years.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely. Absolutely. So is there anything you think that I got wrong or wasn't understanding here tonight?\nJOSH: No, not at all.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: We delved pretty briefly into everything.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. Well then I am gonna be back here in Chicago next week so we can catch up with the homework and we can talk about your week as well as anything else that you think is indicative of the larger pattern that we've identified. Or the treatment goals of overcoming avoidance and reducing depression.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay?\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Alright. Well enjoy class as much as you can tonight and have a terrific weekend.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Good to see you.\nJOSH: Yeah, good to see you too. It feels like it was just yesterday.\nAMY WENZEL: It was, a week ago exactly. Exactly. You know I was taking a look at your questionnaires here and again it looks like your mood's been pretty good over the past week. Is that right?\nJOSH: Yeah, it's been pretty consistent.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. On the depression scale your score was just one point higher than last week. But still, down from when I first met you.\nJOSH: Yeah, certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Anxiety, the exact same rating that you gave it last week.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. How would you explain the now persistent change in drop in your score?\nJOSH: I think it's the beginning of the semester all the exams were coming at me. And now some of the exams are behind me. So I think that's like, it helps a little bit to get some feedback that's positive.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: On the exams.\nAMY WENZEL: Terrific. I wanna hear more about that definitely.\nJOSH: Yeah. So it's been good.\nAMY WENZEL: Can you attribute any of that to anything we're doing in here?\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean just recognizing some of the bad habits, I guess I have when automatic thoughts and everything.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So what did you end up taking away from our last visit last week?\nJOSH: Um, just in more of the positive things that I've done versus the negative things that I've done.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I started like, I guess, just stacking myself up higher on just realizing my accomplishments. So writing things down definitely helps. But even just like thinking in my head, I write them down after the fact. So just having them, I don't know, on like a bookshelf in my mind, I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: A kind of bookshelf in your mind. That's terrific.\nJOSH: Usually I just start to worry about the next thing but I think a lot of the identifying, I don't know just the way like you slowed things down in my head, just thinking too quickly about how wrong things could go.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: Um, so I've just been like slowing things, like my reactions down in my head. So even when I'm at work, I even told my girlfriend, cause she has anxiety too, I said, \"You just need to stop and realize that you need to go home from work and this just won't be a problem after that.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So what we're doing in here is making an impact.\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: That's terrific. And I know you sent me via email the homework where you were identifying the automatic thoughts and associating them with the thinking traps. There's a second part of your homework too. Do you remember that?\nJOSH: The success log.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Yeah. Did you have an opportunity to do that?\nJOSH: Yeah, it's in the email. I sent it to you.\nAMY WENZEL: Is it? Oh, I didn't see, oh I apologize.\nJOSH: It was underneath the table.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh goodness. And I was printing out this first page and I was so excited it could fit on one page. So.\nJOSH: It's okay. It was, I have a success log.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So we could definitely, I'd love to talk about the automatic thoughts, talk about the success log, how that's effected your view of yourself as being a success versus failure. What else do you wanna accomplish in here today?\nJOSH: I mean, I think just talking about those are good.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\n\nJOSH: But yeah I did do the success log. So I remember them pretty freshly too. So that shouldn't be a problem.\nAMY WENZEL: Well tell me a little bit about the success log. What did you put on there?\nJOSH: Um, well last week when I was here, I got like a bad, undesirable grade on an exam in an accounting class. And I was anxious about going to that class that day.\nAMY WENZEL: So that was the class that we were talking about the last time, the 7:30 class.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And you were struggling with whether or not you were going to go but leave partway through or stay the whole time. What happened?\nJOSH: I definitely left early.\nAMY WENZEL: You left early?\nJOSH: Because Will left early too.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Um, but I'm glad I went to the class cause I didn't really wanna go to the class but when I did go, the professor said, \"Yeah, I'm gonna get all the students to retake the exam online.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Really?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I got 21 out of 22 on the accounting.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh terrific.\nJOSH: So yeah. So my grade definitely got boosted.\nAMY WENZEL: And you put that on the success log. Can I just ask you one thing? You were avoiding the class and you, one of the automatic thoughts that we were working with last week was that you were pretty sure that you failed the exam and that you were probably gonna squeak by in the class but it was gonna be pretty uncomfortable.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And we actually even talked about the fact that sometimes when everybody in the class does poorly, professors oftentimes reconsider a little bit. So what is this experience and how can you learn from this for the future?\nJOSH: Just not to be worried about going to the class after the exam. And even the university I went to before this, it was like if you asked me, \"Josh, when's the next time you're gonna skip class?\" It would be the next class after the exam. I never showed up to the class after the exam.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And I guess I thought it was kind of cool saying it, when I was a sophomore in college. But I guess I was just avoiding the inevitable.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. So this time you went to class even though you didn't want to.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And you got some good news, that everybody could retake the exam.\nJOSH: Yeah and I improved my grade a lot over the weekend.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Good.\nJOSH: So that felt good. But then I even faced a lot of anxiety retaking the exam. So it was on my success list that I did it.\nAMY WENZEL: Terrific, terrific. What else was on your success log?\nJOSH: Um, do you know I'm trying to think cause I just was thinking about that big one. Uh I've had some successes in work about not leaving early.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I had to open up, there's usually somebody at my office who's like the main, it's a small office, she's like the main stay-man. If she's not there, we all kind of fall apart. But I ran the office without her for an entire day. So.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh terrific.\nJOSH: I mean that was good.\nAMY WENZEL: What did that do to your idea that you're a failure?\nJOSH: Um I don't know, just that I could do it by myself if I really wanted to. But it's not so much being a failure or a success. It was just like handling all the employees. Cause I mean I know what I'm doing in my job. But I'm too young to be telling, at least I feel too young to be telling people who are like 50 years old how to paint and clean apartments and stuff. So when the older lady's not there, and I can tell her what to do too. She's really good about it. But when she's not there it's kinda hard to drive her authority from the age. So I guess that's kinda like a business problem more or less than a psychological too I suppose.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh absolutely. I mean it sounds like there are dynamics there at work which we talked about the first time that we met. And you're the youngest person who works there. You're also the only family member, right?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so you had this task where you needed to step in and really run things and you did it. Solved the problem, you did it effectively. Great, great.\nJOSH: And I haven't been letting my dad does the painting in the building, like all the apartments cause he used to be a painter. And he pisses everybody off. So I'm always dealing with that. But I haven't been letting it effect my mood lately. I've just been kind of reflecting it.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Great. So the overall effect for you of keeping the success log was what?\nJOSH: Um, just being aware, like an awareness.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: It kinda stops complacency when you know that you can do better.\nAMY WENZEL: Great, okay, okay. Now remember I told you last time I had a client I worked with who accumulated 130 items on his success log? Um, I would love to see you continue to do this over more than just a week's period of time.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So you can start to accumulate your 130. So you have just such an array of evidence that's irrefutable that you'll be able to see when you're feeling badly about yourself or when you're feeling down or unsure that you'll be able to solve problems or succeed. What do you think?\nJOSH: I think that's a good idea.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I like the idea of a success log.\nAMY WENZEL: Good.\nJOSH: It kinda goes in with making lists to stay organized.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay, okay. Now last week you expressed some concerns about writing things down although earlier today you actually said that writing things down helps.\nJOSH: Yeah. I guess I write things out of my head and transfer it to paper later.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. The bookshelf.\nJOSH: Yeah, the mental lists I suppose.\nAMY WENZEL: Uh huh. Okay.\nJOSH: But no I've been working more too. It's been busy at work cause it's been the middle of the end of the month and the beginning of the month. Everybody's moving. So it's easier to keep a list at work.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay so writing some things down, at least eventually when you transfer them from your mental bookshelf hasn't been as much of a burden as you might have thought.\nJOSH: No, no.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: No it hasn't been hard to keep the list private either.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I don't want my girlfriend or family to be looking at my list.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So they don't have access to your Evernote.\nJOSH: No.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So you'll continue on with the success log.\nJOSH: Yeah. Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Great. And when you send it next time I'll make sure I scroll down in the email to be able to... I'll be sure to check it out after this visit.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: So, but the other part I do have here, so you were working on identifying automatic thoughts and then detecting whether or not you were falling into a thinking trap.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Do you remember the purpose to doing that?\nJOSH: To prevent falling into the thinking traps?\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah to recognize that and it puts the breaks on your thinking so it gives you the first clue that you might need to step back and evaluate a bit. So it sounds like you had four different things that happened in the past week that were associated with anxiety. Is that right?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So, the first one was procrastinating taking an online quiz. So it's the same... 21 out of...\nJOSH: Same class, different quiz.\nAMY WENZEL: Same class different quiz.\nJOSH: The exam was the one that was to be retaken online and the quiz just always happens.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And is this the same class where we had talked I think last time about you just not even taking a quiz even though...\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, it's the same class.\nJOSH: It's the same one that's tonight. So it's the class I struggle with the most.\nAMY WENZEL: The class you struggle with the most. Okay. An accounting class?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: It's not even auditing, it's a dry accounting class. It's the fine print.\nAMY WENZEL: The fine print. Okay. It sounds really brutal.\nJOSH: Yeah. The professor has an accent that I told you about.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right, so the material isn't compelling and then unfortunately you're not clicking with the professor.\nJOSH: No.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So I'm looking here, so you wrote down for the thought, \"I just didn't wanna do it.\"\nJOSH: No, I just didn't wanna do that.\nAMY WENZEL: You know, and when we talked about this before, I think we had to identify some thoughts that underlie that idea that I just don't wanna do it.\nJOSH: Yeah, it's the fear of the failure.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you think that's another thought I should write down underneath? \"I'm gonna fail.\" Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: But I mean I also wrote down how just sometimes just logging onto blackboard causes me anxiety. And blackboard's our system where you just take all the online quizzes.\nAMY WENZEL: I actually know that.\nJOSH: Okay. I mean I know they call it a hundred different names out there in the industry. But I'm just worried some day I'm gonna log on and there'll be a message pop up saying, \"You've been rejected from this course,\" for some reason. You're out of control, it's just out of your control.\nAMY WENZEL: So it sounds like there's also another automatic thought there like, \"I'm gonna get bad news.\"\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Or even catastrophic news.\nJOSH: I, I don't know, this is like my sixth year in college and I'm graduating this semester but I've had so many setbacks I'm just, every time I get like really close it's like,\nAMY WENZEL: Have you gotten those types of messages before? That there's some sort of catastrophe?\nJOSH: Well I was supposed to graduate last semester.\nAMY WENZEL: And what happened?\nJOSH: Um I just didn't have one of the courses that I was supposed to have. And then when I was told I had to take another semester, I just took all accounting courses.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: So now I have enough but.\nAMY WENZEL: And did you find out about that by logging on the computer and having a message pop up?\nJOSH: It was an email.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you have had one experience like that where it was hoisted on you. Okay.\nJOSH: And then I mean like I've failed a course at ISU. And it felt like it was the end of the world even though it wasn't.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So there's a couple things that happened that I guess helps to make sense why you would have the orientation when you log onto blackboard and you're expecting to get these messages.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: You wrote down here as a thinking trap, all or nothing thinking, which I do think applies to the, \"Boy, I just don't wanna do it.\"\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: What about the \"I'm gonna fail and I'm gonna get bad news?\" Do you think you're falling into a trap there?\nJOSH: Yeah, just magnification, right.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah absolutely magnification. I think you might be jumping to a conclusion as well.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Which I think you definitely were doing last week when you were pretty sure that you failed and that it was gonna put you in a really uncomfortable position in the class.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: When you got to retake the exam and did terrifically.\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean she's still gonna average it with the other score but definitely not bad now.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So it was recoverable, as Will said.\nJOSH: Recoverable.\nAMY WENZEL: Recoverable. Okay. And then so you were doing some tax homework, so this is a different class.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And your automatic thought is \"I did it incorrectly.\"\nJOSH: Yeah, taxes are complicated.\nAMY WENZEL: I can imagine.\nJOSH: And I have my first exam in that class tomorrow.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But one of my things in my success log is I actually went to the optional class on Tuesday. The only reason I drive 45 minutes to go to school is to go to the class that isn't optional. So we made it optional. I was sure that I wasn't gonna go. But then I went and I'm glad I did. So now I'm more prepared for the exam tomorrow.\nAMY WENZEL: That's terrific. How did you, what made you go?\nJOSH: Um, I didn't wanna be at home.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I texted Will and he says, \"Yeah, I'm going to it.\" He said it can't hurt.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And I hadn't missed that class, not once. And I know that once I miss a class it's harder to go to it again.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

But there's a reason you're gonna miss it, because you have the exam. Okay.\nJOSH: For the exam.\nAMY WENZEL: You know I am just kind of curious. What are you gonna do when you're not taking a class with Will?\nJOSH: Ha ha ha. I don't know. It's just nice, even when it's not with Will, you always find a classmate or two in a class to stay in touch with and everything.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And I have other people that I talk to in my classes that I've been in groups with before. There's a small circle in the accounting.\nAMY WENZEL: It always helps to have friends or comrades, whether it's in a class or even in the real world with a job who can kinda walk by your side when you're doing the hard things. I think my wish would be that along with utilizing that sort of social support, you can also figure out something that you can say to yourself that will help you focus on the positive consequences of approaching some of these things and overcoming some of the avoidance when you don't wanna do the things.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Remember last week we had talked about the opportunity to learn how to build up that tolerance of uncertainty or the intolerance of discomfort?\nJOSH: Yeah. And I think I'm getting better at it.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. There's no question you're getting better at it.\nJOSH: Yeah. I had to go to the graduation preparation commencement thing. And I think that was, I was anxious to go to that.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right, right. Well that's interesting. So you were worried that you had the tax homework incorrectly, you had anxiety. And then you also said on here, your last item is you went to the graduation commencement preparation. And you were also basically worried that something bad was gonna happen. So there's a pattern there with both of them.\nJOSH: Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: I'm just ready for the bad news, like one more year in school, Joshua.\nAMY WENZEL: So I wonder if the jumping to conclusions, if that underlies all of this.\nJOSH: Perhaps. I just worry a lot about being done.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. You're ready to be done.\nJOSH: I can't wait to get out of academia.\nAMY WENZEL: You're ready to be done.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. So you had written down magnification, which I definitely think is relevant. You also wrote down with the going to the graduating commencement preparation, disqualifying the positive. What were you disqualifying?\nJOSH: That I was graduating college, I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. You're forgetting about all the credits that you had accumulated.\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean I told my work, cause I had to leave early from work, I was like, \"I gotta go to this thing.\" And I guess I hadn't really told some people that I'm graduating this semester. So they're all excited and they're like, \"Oh, congratulations.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Why were you not telling them?\nJOSH: Just in case.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, I was wondering.\nJOSH: I mentioned it to people but I mean just like just it's gonna happen.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And the, did you, you actually did go to the graduation commencement?\nJOSH: Yeah, I got my cap and gown and everything.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Can anybody take that cap and gown away from you?\nJOSH: No.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: No, they can't.\nAMY WENZEL: So you have a lot of evidence now that it's happening.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah, definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, that's terrific. Congratulations.\nJOSH: Thank you.\n\nAMY WENZEL: And then the other thing on here. Oh I wanted to talk about this one. So you were transferring some money to your girlfriend's account.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And the automatic thought you wrote down was, \"Money,\" in capital letters. What does that mean?\nJOSH: I just hate doing things with money. I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: It was like a two week process where I had to verify the account with her bank and my bank to be able to transfer some money we bought with her PayPal account instead of my PayPal account.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: For some reason I just kept on avoiding doing it. I had the money, the money's already gone in my mind. But, I don't know. I probably have a thing with money.\nAMY WENZEL: Well you mentioned some automatic thoughts last week that were associated with money. Do you remember what those were?\nJOSH: No, I just think it's like a stereotypical thing of somebody my age that works part-time being worried about money a lot. So I always kind of attribute it to that. But it's definitely a big stresser in my life.\nAMY WENZEL: Well you know I'm glad that you brought this up because on the one hand absolutely struggles with money are normal and there's certainly nothing out of the ordinary, especially if you work a part-time job. And you're facing a big transition in your life. On the other hand, though, you keep telling me how stressed you are. So I actually do wonder if there might be some of these thinking traps at work.\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely. Being out of money, I mean we talked about that last week.\nAMY WENZEL: Exactly.\nJOSH: But.\nAMY WENZEL: The concept that I recall working with last week was that a thought such as, \"I'm gonna need the money for something.\" Or, \"something's gonna come up and I'm not going to have the money.\" Is that right?\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So is that probably what was going on here?\nJOSH: Certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I'm just witness to a lot of bad financial situations in people that, I don't know. And I'm an accounting major so.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, so you're sensitized to it.\nJOSH: I gotta do all the math in my head without thinking about it, how much somebody makes and everything.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I'm always qualifying people on income and credit every day. So I feel like my income and credit better be pretty good.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: That kinda happens.\nAMY WENZEL: So you're kinda primed to be thinking about this and to be noticing little things.\nJOSH: Yeah. And I judge people who have car payments that they can't afford em.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: Really quickly.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: A lot of car payments out there.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure, sure. So you judge other people but you're also stressed out would suggest that you also have some thoughts about yourself.\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah. I'm always judging myself.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And judging yourself in what way? What do you say?\nJOSH: I try to be as frugal as possible. And it's just not wasting, I don't know. I see a lot of people just kind of ruin their lives in their first five years of having credit.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: So I've been exposed to that my entire life.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: Always raised to be very frugal.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: Um, which I don't know how a middle class family like my parents did that. Cause we certainly didn't have nothing. But I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Well it sounds to me like, in many ways you're making some very good decisions with money. And it's in fact decisions that many other people don't make and hence they have bad credit scores or get in debt.\nJOSH: Like maybe everybody else should be as worried as I am about the credit system.\nAMY WENZEL: Well, you know, I would encourage us to go for balance. You know, you're making good decisions, you're setting yourself up for the future, but you're also stressing yourself out a little bit.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Where would the middle ground be?\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: And that costs me money down the road.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. What's an example?\nJOSH: Um, like I've had to take out a third party student loan before 'cause I didn't have my FAFSA stuff done.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And that costs you money down the road.\nAMY WENZEL: You're right. You're right.\nJOSH: With interest and everything else from not taking the free money from the government.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Yep. Didn't get it done in time, paying for it now.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. So this is terrific work. I guess if we were to draw a conclusion from this, what would it be?\nJOSH: Um, not to jump to conclusions.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: I don't know, you learn more about teaching. I was just telling my girlfriend earlier, like some of the stuff that we were working on.\nAMY WENZEL: Uh huh.\nJOSH: About the slowing down of thoughts. And she freaks out about stuff sometimes too.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So it sounds like you're actually talking about this to her, I guess consolidates this for you. You're putting your own words onto it so you're describing the theory and the strategies and what not and it just kinda makes it gel for you all the more.\nJOSH: Oh, yeah. Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Well I have something else for you. Can I share that with you?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: This is actually one of my favorite things that I share with people.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: This is, I call these evaluation questions. And these are just questions that you can begin to ask yourself once you notice that you're falling into a thinking trap to start to get that distance and perspective and balance. You don't have to ask yourself all of these questions. These are just a sampling of some of our more common questions that we ask. But the goal here is really to start critically examining these automatic thoughts once you recognize that a trap might be at work. And then taking a step back and really honestly answering these questions.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: So if you could imagine the capital letter L. So we've been traveling down the vertical part of the L where we've been identifying the thoughts and identifying the thinking trap, if your thinking is a bit inaccurate or unhelpful, we wanna turn the corner. And this is like the 90 degree angle where the vertical meets the horizontal. So this really shows you how to start thinking in a different direction. So I'm already seeing you glance over those questions. What are some questions that you are seeing as potentially helpful for you to get that distance and balance?\nJOSH: Uh, like the worst, best case scenario questions and most realistic outcome.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, I really like those questions for people who jump to conclusions and the reason is when you go through and you honestly answer what's the very worst, but what's the best and what's the most realistic, I would say in my experience about 95 percent of the time, the best outcome and the most realistic are really really similar. And the most realistic is much further away from the worst case scenario.\nJOSH: I guess it depends on your imagination.\nAMY WENZEL: Ha ha. Depends on your imagination. There's another set of questions in the same area of those and that's like; well if the worst were to happen, how would I cope? And I think that we actually got to that a little bit last week with money. Where you were saying, \"Okay, if I, if something came up and I know I didn't have the money, I could work extra, I could go to my family, I don't wanna do that. I don't like doing it. But it is an option that's kind of in the background, right? So when you ask yourself, \"Okay, how would I cope?\" It might not be, it might not feel great but it doesn't have to be catastrophic. Is that right?\nJOSH: Yeah. Um, I think you're completely right. I don't know, sometimes I worry when I start, \"What's the worst thing hat could happen?\" If the worst thing that could happen isn't that bad, sometimes I'm just prone to just let the worst thing happen.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. Because then you give yourself permission to avoid, right?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: That's really insightful actually. So that brings me to another point here. Sometimes it's good to ask a number of these questions together. And so you could ask yourself about the best, the worst, the most realistic. And then if you start to ask yourself or you start to feel yourself moving towards that avoidance, you could ask yourself, \"Okay, what would be he consequences of avoidance?\" In fact I don't even have a question on there that specifically reads what are the consequences of avoidance but it's another one of those evaluation questions in the same spirit. And you might, how would you answer that question? What would be the consequence of avoidance then for you?\nJOSH: I mean sometimes it's like when I answer that question to myself it's like the couch springer, it gets you off your butt to go like \"Oh, can't have that happen.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: You fail this course, you gotta be home a little bit longer.\nAMY WENZEL: I think you're kind of doing that now with school. I mean you've described this semester as being do or die time for you.\nJOSH: Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: The couch spring has sprung, right?\nJOSH: It keeps springing.\nAMY WENZEL: It keeps springing. Okay. Okay. You know, another question I really like on there is the evidence question. So asking yourself \"What evidence really supports this idea?\" \"What evidence is inconsistent with this idea?\" So you're looking at the full pool of information or evidence that surrounds the way that you're viewing a situation. And you have to take into account all of it in order to be more balanced. And I wonder if the evidence question would have been a real nice one for the graduation commencement preparation, where you were disqualifying the positive.\nJOSH: Certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, so the evidence that you were disqualifying was what?\nJOSH: Um, I don't know, just that they invited me to go to the graduation commencement preparation.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: Just that I was even told about it. But I mean also like the worst case scenario that I often think to myself if I didn't graduate is that I am so on the line that it could only ever take me until the rest of the summer to finish school.\nAMY WENZEL: What do you mean on the line?\nJOSH: Like I mean the requirements that I need to graduate college, I am so, I am not that far away that whatever, if for instance the worst thing happened, I failed a class, I would be able to make up for it within a month after.\nAMY WENZEL: This is great, Josh.\nJOSH: By like June or July I'd be done with it.\nAMY WENZEL: This is the first time I'm hearing you say that because last time, certainly the first time I met you, but also last time, you have presented in this all or nothing manner that \"I have to graduate this semester or everything's over.\" And it looks like you are gonna graduate. It looks like you've done a terrific job. But there's a backup, I mean, that you would just graduate a month, month and a half later, if you had to take a class in the summer session.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right?\nJOSH: Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: When you acknowledge that, how does that make you feel?\nJOSH: It makes me feel better but I gotta not be complacent about it.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, and so there's your balance. And I think, again, I'm glad that you brought up the fact that it's easy to give yourself permission to avoid if you start viewing the worst case scenario as not so bad.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So the combination of asking questions so as not to catastrophize but then pairing it with what are the consequences then of avoiding. It sounds like the consequences are that you stay stuck in the same pattern.\nJOSH: Yeah, it's hard to catch yourself when you start, I don't know, just saying things like, \"What's the worst thing that could happen? Oh, that's not so bad.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. Since we began our work together, I'm wondering, how successful would you view yourself in overcoming avoidance? If you were to give it a percentage? Zero percent? 50? 100?\nJOSH: I guess 60 percent.\nAMY WENZEL: 60 percent. That's terrific.\nJOSH: I probably started a bit lower than that.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

I'm thinking three out of five is where I'm at now.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So we have added another 20 percent towards your treatment goal of overcoming avoidance. Okay. Um, we certainly have these questions, these things that you could ask yourself in order to view these situations in a balanced way. What else is it gonna take for us to then push it past that 60 percent?\nJOSH: Um, a hyena to just follow me around and make sure I get everything done, I suppose.\nAMY WENZEL: Uh huh.\nJOSH: I don't know. Just practice. I've always believed in practice.\nAMY WENZEL: Well and you're doing a lot of practicing, you're being really consistent here with the homework.\nJOSH: Yeah. Sometimes you gotta wonder if that's what college is for. But I can't imagine everybody has anxiety problems, I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So are you actually viewing college as sort of like giving you some life lessons?\nJOSH: Oh certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: Practicing.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And I see that a lot cause I'm the only one in my family that went to college. So sometimes I see people really struggle with things that aren't that complicated.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. I didn't realize nobody in your family went to college. I mean, I wonder if that's again one of these background types of experiences that feeds into how we should understand your academic anxiety.\nJOSH: Yeah, nobody knew, nobody understood why I had to apply to graduate college. They just thought that once you were done, you were done.\nAMY WENZEL: Once you're done, you are done. Okay.\nJOSH: That's the end of it.\nAMY WENZEL: Do you carry as lot of pressure because...\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah, my brother, he didn't go to college and he's like, he has a small business, I guess. And I have a little sister so.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh you do?\nJOSH: I feel like whoever does the best is, she'll either go to college or she won't.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. Do you believe that by completing college then you're gonna assume some sort of role in the family that?\nJOSH: I assume by completing college and getting a job, I'll assume some sort of role in the family.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: It's not just enough to go to school anymore.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: You have to get a job afterwards.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So, kinda where I'm at with that.\nAMY WENZEL: Well what's interesting to me about this conversation is that you don't have any role models really in terms of to follow in terms of just going along that path of applying to and being at, completing college.\nJOSH: Yeah. Something I say a lot is my kids won't struggle as much with college as I did.\nAMY WENZEL: Yep. So these life lessons that you're getting, you're gonna be able to impart a lot (inaudible ) on there.\nJOSH: What wisdom can I gain?\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. What wisdom can you gain. How can you achieve personal growth or grow as a person.\nJOSH: Yeah, that's like the Malcolm Gladwell, David and Goliath book.\nAMY WENZEL: Yep. Yep.\nJOSH: Desirable difficulties. I think I'm growing as a person.\nAMY WENZEL: You absolutely are.\nJOSH: But, I've had a lot handed to me too. So.\nAMY WENZEL: Well don't disqualify the positive there because just in the short time that I've known you, you're doing some great work here.\nJOSH: Thanks.\nAMY WENZEL: So in fact I'm gonna flip over this page.\nJOSH: To the paperwork.\nAMY WENZEL: Yes, to the paperwork that you don't do on paper, that you do on Evernote. Do you notice what I've added there?\nJOSH: Yeah, the evaluation questions.\nAMY WENZEL: The evaluation questions. So could you write down one or more of these questions that you can start to ask yourself and start to answer in order to get that distance and perspective?\nJOSH: Yeah, I can definitely do that.\nAMY WENZEL: Alright.\nJOSH: We'll add it to the Evernote.\nAMY WENZEL: You'll add to the Evernote. That's terrific. Now one thing I was not seeing on your homework, were any of those sort of socially anxious type of situations, like last time we talked about some nervousness around your girlfriend's father and her father's girlfriend.\nJOSH: Yeah, I didn't see them this weekend.\nAMY WENZEL: You didn't see them this weekend.\nJOSH: No, they were doing something else. I barely saw her this weekend. So I mean.\nAMY WENZEL: So you've been busy.\nJOSH: Yeah. I don't really have too many social situations.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I can be an awkward person sometimes.\nAMY WENZEL: Right right.\nJOSH: Even though I'm fine at work, I see a lot of people at work, I could talk to somebody off the street, take him in, show him around.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah.\nJOSH: But I can't operate in groups sometimes. I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: Well and I'm also wondering if there's some anxiety around your girlfriend, not necessarily with your girlfriend, but in situations where somehow then she could conclude that you're not as desirable as she might have thought. Am I right about that?\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely. Oh yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: That's every guy's head I think. They just wanna maintain status quo in the relationship.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: Make sure you're still desirable.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. Does anxiety or stress associated with that concern, is that something we should work on together?\nJOSH: No, I think a lot of that's gonna be over after I get a job.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: I have to prove to her father that I can support myself.\nAMY WENZEL: What makes you think you have to prove that to him?\nJOSH: He won't let me buy beer while we're out.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: \"Not until you have a job.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Oh really? So he actually says that to you.\nJOSH: Oh yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So that's another one of those, I was wondering if there was evidence that... but you have evidence.\nJOSH: Yeah. And I gave him my word when his daughter graduated that I was gonna graduate this last December.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And then I didn't.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But I'm probably gonna get a better job out of it, from going to school. I got a lot more accounting classes under my belt and I'm close to getting a CPA so.\nAMY WENZEL: So there's another side of the coin. It ended up not being so bad that you didn't graduate in December.\nJOSH: Yeah. I had to work a lot to make that sound good and get everything I needed done.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I had to picture that one.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So really it sounds like he definitely gives you the verbal indication that you have something to prove and you're doing it. Okay.\nJOSH: I don't blame him. It's his daughter so it's reasonable. So.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. Okay.\nJOSH: Do what you can do.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But I'm always out there kind of to prove it to him that I don't know, that he'd let me. Eventually I'll probably ask him to marry her unless we break up. So...\nAMY WENZEL: You're serious.\nJOSH: Yeah, we've been dating for three years. If we don't plan on getting married, we would probably just break up.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Wouldn't be really a reason to date. But that's kinda like a Christian vision I've always had.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Growing up.\nAMY WENZEL: So this transition that you're facing with graduating and getting a job, there might also be a marriage proposal in there.\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah. Shopping for condos and...\nAMY WENZEL: Oh the shopping for condos. You're right, you're right.\nJOSH: Yeah, I was supposed to see one on Saturday but it sold.

psychological counseling dialogue:\n```\nJOSH: I think as long as I start a career, and can really get myself into it, that I'll be fine.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And I think I wasn't able to get myself quite into my education.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: At Bloomington Normal.\nAMY WENZEL: And how are you gonna do that? Get really into your career?\nJOSH: Um you know like when they say you first start a job, you kinda cut your teeth and for like a couple of years and just, I just kinda do that.\nAMY WENZEL: Work hard.\nJOSH: It's an entry level position, yeah. And I don't have a problem working hard when I'm getting paid. But it's real hard pain to work hard at school.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, so at school at times there can be some avoidance and procrastination. But it sounds like you view work as being different enough that the avoidance and procrastination won't be as much of an issue there?\nJOSH: Yeah, I'm very efficient. And I try to be really effective at work. So I mean, I am all over work.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: So our occupancy is way up.\nAMY WENZEL: Well what can you learn then from work to apply to these other situations where you procrastinate?\nJOSH: It's just night and day for me; work and education. I can't wait to start a different job so I can put the same amount of work into my work into that. But I don't know, I guess it's the work has more immediate reward. And so sometimes it's easier just to do that and to be recognized for it whereas an education, it's more like deferring the gratification.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you're a person who needs immediate rewards.\nJOSH: I try not to be but if I'm being honest with myself, definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: You know yourself. You know yourself. And the career, you were saying you were gonna pursue a type of tax job. Is that right?\nJOSH: Yeah, auditing or tax auditing.\nAMY WENZEL: Tax auditing. Oh boy. You and I might be enemies at one point here.\nJOSH: Ha ha. No.\nAMY WENZEL: So tax auditing. And do you have something lined up?\nJOSH: Nope, not at all.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: I have been working at the place I'm working now, I have moved over to the accounting area, over there kind of working with the books.\nAMY WENZEL: Terrific.\nJOSH: I don't agree with how things are done so it's kinda hard to make any changes.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But I think it'll be good. I don't think it'll be really hard for me to get an entry level job with my education.\nAMY WENZEL: Good for you.\nJOSH: But it'll probably be hard. I think I'll get a job, it's probably the job I want.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah but you know what you're doing right now is you're so being so balanced about this. So you're not catastrophizing about the possibility of not getting a job, you have enough confidence in yourself that you know one's gonna come your way. You actually, now that you're moving into the accounting area in the place where you work, now you're actually getting some experience, I think.\nJOSH: Yeah, a little bit.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: But I still have a lot of anxiety about filling out my resume. I have a resume, I have a lot of anxiety about updating it. And I have a lot of anxiety about applying for jobs.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Even though I think I'm qualified to get one.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. You know I'm writing this down. Anxiety about resume, and anxiety about applying for jobs. Um, you know I don't think we're gonna have enough time here today to, cause those are big areas. But what do you think about putting this in our agenda for when I come back in town?\nJOSH: Uh, that's fine.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Because this is really the first time you've mentioned anxiety about it. In fact, like I was saying, I think you're actually being confident and balanced.\nJOSH: I mean, I can go to a job fair and talk to people.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: I just don't wanna write my resume.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: I don't know what that means.\nAMY WENZEL: You know, I guess just because you write a resume you don't automatically get a job. Vthat's not immediate gratification there.\nJOSH: Yeah, I suppose.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. But I wonder if we could talk some about the automatic thoughts that come up when you're sitting down to do the resume or when you're applying for jobs. And we could take a look at how they relate to our model here but also see what types of traps you're falling into and whether there are some things that we can start to do to help you critically evaluate and take a step back from those.\nJOSH: Okay, that'll be good.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. So I'll definitely, I'm gonna write a note here for next time. So it'll be two weeks before I come back here.\nJOSH: Good.\nAMY WENZEL: Good.\nJOSH: Spring break is next week and I had to ask about that cause I wasn't quite sure.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Doing anything nice for spring break?\nJOSH: I'm thinking about dipping down to ISU for a while. They're having spring break right now. Probably be having some fun.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, good for you. Good for you. Good. Take some time off, relax, enjoy the break. Anything coming up here then in the next couple of weeks where you can see yourself avoiding or procrastinating?\nJOSH: Just school.\nAMY WENZEL: Just school.\nJOSH: Historically, February is always, not February, I guess March, I guess this time right now in the semester is usually where I start to lose track.\nAMY WENZEL: So kind of after the first round of midterms.\nJOSH: I'll go to one class and hold on to the other one. So I just gotta really keep my focus wide on all these courses.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: And that's just a previous habit that I've acknowledged to myself that I have.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So what's gonna be different this time?\nJOSH: I'm seeing a psychologist every Wednesday.\nAMY WENZEL: Alright, alright.\nJOSH: I don't know. The financial office asked me that too.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I don't know. I'm doing better. All my classes are going well. I haven't really missed any classes yet. I missed one lately but besides that I've at least showed up for the beginning of it. I've left early a couple times but.\nAMY WENZEL: Right right.\nJOSH: Some people just do that during the night time classes.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. It sounds to me that you are more in tune with this pattern of avoidance. It sounds like it is something that you wanna overcome. Luckily it doesn't seem to affect you in the work realm and that's what you're heading into with your work and your career.\nJOSH: It can't affect me yet. So I'm anxious about that.\nAMY WENZEL: Well well I think we have three more visits together. And this was really the primary issue that brought you in here. So I do wonder if maybe we can do what I call coping ahead or really thinking ahead to use this time as a springboard to just jump into this next phase in your life in a way that's proactive and positive and that really is associated with good habits that have been established. What do you think of that?\nJOSH: I like how you said the springboard.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, I'm writing down springboard right here.\nJOSH: Sounds nice.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Yeah so we'll do some of what I call coping ahead.\nJOSH: Yeah that sounds like something I could use.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So what did you learn in here today?\nJOSH: Um, I think we just verified some of the avoidance things that I have and I'm gonna work on the questions.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: So I can kind of see where it's going, you know. We're gonna add more columns every week and hopefully we'll get there. So.\nAMY WENZEL: Eventually there's an end to the columns.\nJOSH: Yeah? So I mean just keep on going at it.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. Good. Good. And so for homework you're gonna do what?\nJOSH: Probably just keep on doing what I'm doing and add the column to the log. I got the success list.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, exactly. Those two things.\nJOSH: So we'll talk more about that next week I guess.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

It's good to see you.\nJOSH: Yeah, it's great to see you Dr. Wenzel.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Have a good spring break?\nJOSH: Yeah, it was pretty good. I got a lot of work done.\nAMY WENZEL: Good. Very good. Very good. And you made it to see your friends at ISU?\nJOSH: Um, no, not yet. That's this weekend.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, this weekend. Okay. So some work then also some play.\nJOSH: Yep.\nAMY WENZEL: Alright. Well I've taken a look at your questionnaires here and again scores are dropping even more actually. I think you're one point lower than you were last time on the depression scale. Yeah, so would you agree that things continue to go in the direction you want them to go?\nJOSH: Yeah, things are going pretty good.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I'm headed into like a bulk of midterms slash final preparations, right now.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So hoping to keep things going in a good direction.\nAMY WENZEL: Well it's interesting that you say that because your anxiety questionnaire, your scoring at the exact same level you were before, and that was really low. So only a three on that.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So despite the fact that you're going into this time of lots of tests and some stress, you're keeping it under wraps.\nJOSH: Yep.\nAMY WENZEL: Alright. So what did you end up remembering about our previous session two weeks ago?\nJOSH: I just remember the questions that we started asking during like a certain situation with the anxiety, like how much is this really gonna effect what you're worried about. And does this really mean that this is gonna happen, like analyze the cause and effect.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: So we put one more step into the thought process, I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. So you've had a couple of weeks to think about that. Is it making sense to you?\nJOSH: Um, yeah, the questions are nice to ask yourself, like when you are freaking out. And I think that because on there was a few situations I put in my log where I didn't get overly upset about something or too worried about it.\nAMY WENZEL: So what we're doing in here, is it making a difference?\nJOSH: Yeah, I think so.\nAMY WENZEL: That's terrific, great. So what were you hoping to accomplish in here today?\nJOSH: Um, I don't know. We could talk about some of the things on my list. I'm a little anxious about doing some work for an online class. But I think I'll be able to get over it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So maybe what we can do is certainly review the homework and there's two parts to the homework, there's the success log or the log of accomplishments, then also the thought record where you were playing the evaluation questions. Right? So we could talk about those as well. It sounds like maybe we should do some coping ahead to deal with the stress associated with the online class that you're nervous about.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. You know and right towards the end of last time, we identified some anxiety about the transition. So on the one hand you had said that you were pretty confident that you could get an entry level job in your area. But on the other hand, you were saying that doing the resume creates more anxiety, something that you procrastinate. And then you started to have some more worries about that transition. So is that something that you wanna talk about in here today if we have time to do that?\nJOSH: Yeah, if we have time.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: That would be good.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Sound like a good game plan?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Alright, so I was able to print out the homework in its entirety this time.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Which one do you wanna start with? The success log or the...\nJOSH: It's up to you. Whatever you had in mind.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Well we can start with the success log cause it's on page one here. So what you wrote were accomplishments the week of March 19th and then accomplishments this week.\nJOSH: I kinda forgot that we didn't meet last week. So I had different lists going.\nAMY WENZEL: That's okay. That's okay. So last week it says on here you worked extra hours, almost double your hours, so that's what you meant by working a lot over spring break. Okay. And to give your quote on quote \"Work mom\" a little vacation. Is that your grandma?\nJOSH: No, no. Just this lady that works for my grandma.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, okay. Okay.\nJOSH: She's like kind of the office manager.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you had a sense of accomplishment.\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah. She really needed the time off. She works a lot for my family. So it was nice that she was able to get off.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: And I needed the extra hours anyway.\nAMY WENZEL: Terrific. Did that give you a sense that you were successful?\nJOSH: Yeah. And it gave me a sense of security, going to the future. Cause I get anxious about money a lot.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So you made some more money and were able to create that buffer for yourself.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Alright. Good. And then you had a diet accomplishment. You've lost four point seven pounds in a week. That's terrific.\nJOSH: Yeah. A little bit water weight probably.\nAMY WENZEL: But were you working on it as well?\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah, I've been on a low carb ketogenic diet for a little while.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, you were saying that. So you're real successful with sticking with that.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah, I was doing good.\nAMY WENZEL: You took your dog on a walk.\nJOSH: Yeah, that's like been a hard thing for us this winter.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. Sure. I really like this item; that you made some time to play the guitar because that was something you got away from.\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah. Definitely. That was nice.\nAMY WENZEL: So how did that contribute to the idea that you're successful?\nJOSH: I don't know. I just, I usually get nervous about getting things done. So much so that I don't do the things that I enjoy.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: I just get nervous. And even if I'm not gonna accomplish anything, I'm still anxious about it. But, so it's hard not to be having all these thoughts running through my head.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: When I do sit down to play guitar.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, but this time you were able to overcome it.\nJOSH: I was able just to relax.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, do you remember what effect that had on your mood?\nJOSH: It was good. Definitely a positive effect. It's the same effect I get when I go for a jog or when I work out.\nAMY WENZEL: Which you also talked about jogging somewhere in your thought record.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So we'll talk more about that. You know, I'm really glad that you brought this up, the making time to enjoy playing the guitar, because I don't know if you remember the very first visit we had, right at the end of the session, you said that you used to play in a band, actually. And that was something you had enjoyed and got away from. And so one of the things that I was thinking of in my mind is what a great way to have just some pure pleasure or pure enjoyment in your life, rather than the work and the toiling and whatnot. So I'd always meant to bring that up to you but we've always had other more pressing things to talk about. So it sounds like you have integrated this into your life and you're noticing the positive benefits.\nJOSH: Yeah, certainly. I mean just like having that whole area of my life, like spiritual or emotional...\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: ...area where it's just hobbies and free time. I guess I've been working on that.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. Good. You scheduled your trip to see your friend, that's coming up this weekend. And you picked up your Sertralin prescription which you had been putting off.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So you overcame the procrastination.\nJOSH: Yeah. And I was only off of it for like a week. So I don't think I'll be affected by being off of it.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. Sure. And you're resuming it now.\nJOSH: Um hmm.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And then this week, I like this one, you bought new khakis. The khakis you're wearing?\nJOSH: The khakis I'm wearing.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

I've been procrastinating that for too long.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: My last khakis, they don't fit anymore cause of my diet, I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: They look really trashy when I wear them so.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay, so you did some shopping.\nJOSH: A work accomplishment.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely. You went to church for the first time in six weeks.\nJOSH: Yes.\nAMY WENZEL: And it seems like that's a real big deal for you.\nJOSH: Yeah it was. I've been anxious about going back to church.\nAMY WENZEL: And I saw that you wrote something about that on your thought records. So we're gonna talk maybe some more about that.\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. You received a good score on BLAW.\nJOSH: Business Law Two.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, business law two. Okay. Okay. And then you were able to maintain a positive attitude, maybe using some of what you learned here.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: When you had the car issue.\nJOSH: Yeah, that was really freaking me out.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. There's a couple others. You took some time off of work to take your mom to the airport. And you wrote in parentheses, \"emotional investment.\"\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I'm gonna move out of the house soon so that's a little bit more important than it used to be to me.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. To spend time with your mom or with things?\nJOSH: Spend time with her.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. And then you started a new audio-book on the Kindle, \"Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.\"\nJOSH: Yes. Always improving, I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Yeah.\nJOSH: Trying to.\n\nAMY WENZEL: So again I know I've asked you this now a couple of times, but just to really consolidate this and make sure that it's achieving its intended effects; why are you keeping the success log? What's the rationale?\nJOSH: So I could look back on it and be confident when I'm anxious about things, that I can get stuff done.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: And it's helped. I was looking at the one from like three weeks ago when I took the business law exam and I felt good about it leaving.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But to get the results back definitely solidifies it, so I can probably put those two together and combine em.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. And remember I was telling you about my client who had 130 items on his success log.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: I wonder how many you have. I mean it looks like you've written between five and seven now for a few weeks.\nJOSH: Yeah. Some of them are smaller, like walking my dog. But I like to celebrate the little things.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely. Absolutely. So what if you were to put them all together and look at the list in its totality?\nJOSH: I guess it would be a good feeling to look at all that.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Is that easy to do...\nJOSH: On the computer, sure.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. So do you think it's achieving its desired effects?\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. I definitely think it is. I wish I had started it like sooner.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: Before like some of my bigger accomplishments. But.\n\n\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. Well we started it now and we're continuing on. You know the other thing, you know our figure here with the core beliefs and we talked about you at times having a core belief of being a failure that gets activated in times of stress or in times when things don't quite go your way. So what I was hoping with the success log is that you would start to accumulate evidence that you're just as successful as the next guy. That you're doing pretty well in the success department.\nJOSH: Yeah, it seems to be going that way.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah.\nJOSH: I hope I get there.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. You know last time I had you make a rating and I think you had said when you first came to see me you believed in the successfulness about 40 percent. And then last week, or two weeks ago you brought it up to 60 percent. Are you still around 60 percent or is this actually bumped it up even higher?\nJOSH: Um, I guess you could bump it up a little bit. I guess I was just talking about successfulness of the whole, the six times that we meet, we got two more times to meet.\nAMY WENZEL: We do. Yep.\nJOSH: So yeah, I guess we went up by ten percent.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Okay. So we're up around 70 now?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Maybe even more if I had known where my worksheet was, for a little bit there where I lost it.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure, sure. Alright so we're around 70 percent. This is encouraging. So you're willing to continue on with the success log, maybe putting them all together so when you're feeling especially down or anxious or you're lacking confidence in yourself, read the entire list. So you see all of this evidence that's accumulating that you're just as successful as the next guy.\nJOSH: Yeah. And I think that's really good and I think it's gonna work for me because one of the things for my diet that I have the app where I watch my weight every day. So having like to be able to look back at the success has helped me with that.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely. Absolutely.\nJOSH: So I guess this would be like a metaphor for that. It's gonna work the same way.\nAMY WENZEL: You got it. You got it. So you're really seeing with this dieting app like your progress from when you started to now.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Like to the tenth, weight.\n\n\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Oh that's terrific. That's great. That's great. So then the thought record here. So you actually had listed five different columns. And so there was a situation, the thought, the emotion. You continued to recognize the thinking traps. And then you asked yourself one or more of these questions, these evaluation questions to really get some distance and perspective. Should we go through these questions?\nJOSH: Yeah, sure.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So it looks like there were four of them. But they're four important ones actually.\nJOSH: Yeah.\n\nAMY WENZEL: So in one situation, as we were talking about, the valve stem on your tire had snapped in half when you went to fill it with air.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: What a sense of dread.\nJOSH: Yeah, I called my car guy, he didn't answer the phone. So I had to like Google it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I was like getting ready to go to school.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, you said it was an hour before your tax class. And the tax class is the one you struggle with, right?\nJOSH: Yeah. It's the most intensive one, I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: It's the one I'm most interested in though. So I didn't wanna miss it. And I hadn't missed one yet.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. You even went to the optional one, right?\nJOSH: Yeah, I even went to the optional one.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: So I drove to school. It didn't pop on the highway. It seemed to be holding in. But then the entire time during my class I was like, \"I'm gonna get out of this classroom and there is going to be no air in my tire.\"\nAMY WENZEL: And that's not even the thought that you wrote here, the thought that you wrote here was, \"I'm gonna have to replace the entire rim.\"\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So a couple of catastrophes there.\nJOSH: Oh yeah. Just anxiety up the whazoo.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: Any time my car is like nearly breaking down, that's like my whole life like everything I need to get done that week isn't gonna happen.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So it sounds like there's a number of thoughts. Like the air is gonna be out. I'm not gonna be able to get done with the stuff I need to do this week. And then this is going to cost a lot of money. So it also goes back to the money.\nJOSH: It all goes back to the money.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. So you recognize that you were jumping to conclusions and the question you asked was, \"Well do I know for certain that the entire rim being broke is the scenario that's gonna happen?\"\nJOSH: Yeah. Cause I don't know anything about cars.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

That's something I might've done, you know, last year.\nAMY WENZEL: So did you actually ask yourself this question, \"Did I know for certain?\" Did you ask it?\nJOSH: Yeah, I was like, uh, it might break, it might not.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: Bit of a risk.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So do you think the fact that you were asking this question, \"Do I know for certain that the entire rim is broken?\" do you think that helped you?\nJOSH: It was just like asking those kind of questions and just slowing down and thinking about it. I asked that question and a couple others like, \"What's the worst that's gonna happen if this does blow up?\" And like you know cause and effect on the tire.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. Okay. So you actually asked a few of these questions and you were able to maintain some level of calmness and you stayed in class and...\nJOSH: I stayed in class. I made it to the tire place and then I was able to not like be all anxious and angry at the waiting room. Sitting in a waiting room for me, especially like an auto place, you get like there's so many other things I'd rather be doing or wanna do or like could've been studying for that exam I have tomorrow night or so on and so on.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure, sure.\nJOSH: But and that was actually just Monday, yesterday.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: But man.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Let me introduce you to the final step of this process. And we can apply it not only to this situation but all of the situations as we talked of them, so you really get some practice with it. Would that be okay?\nJOSH: Yeah. You're gonna give me some more paperwork?\nAMY WENZEL: I am gonna give you just more paperwork that can translate into a final two columns on this diagram.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay? And so this is just some information that you can keep for your reference. The name of the game that we're trying to do here is to construct something that we call an alternative response. And an alternative response is a new and different and more balanced thought that's a bit different than the original automatic thought. Okay? So basically when you start recognizing the traps and you start asking yourself these evaluation questions, if the answers to the evaluation questions suggest that maybe you're thinking in a way that's a bit exaggerated or a bit unhelpful or not taking into account all of the information. You want to then construct this alternative response, this new thought. Does that make sense?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Yeah. So I guess what the answer to that question, \"Do you know for certain that the entire rim broke?\" how do you answer that question?\nJOSH: No, I don't.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: Um, and like just five minutes on a Google search solved that for me.\nAMY WENZEL: I see.\nJOSH: Like jeep parts and do they sell it separately, do you replace the whole thing.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: So I followed that one down.\nAMY WENZEL: So then how can we craft this into an alternative response that you'd be able to really focus on in a helpful way in that moment?\nJOSH: Um, sometimes I'll just say it'll be the whole case Serra Serra but that's kind of procrastinistic sometimes.\nAMY WENZEL: Well I'm glad that you said that because for some people a response like that works. I'm guessing for you that doesn't always work, it's not believable or compelling. So we want these alternative responses to be believable and compelling. Again I think I told you this before, it's not like we're putting on rose colored glasses and just thinking overly positive or thinking the opposite. We wanna be balanced. So there's no question that that having this car issue or this tire issue comes up, it's a hassle. So you wanna acknowledge that. And you wanna acknowledge the other side of the coin.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah.\nJOSH: I guess like maybe it was just like, well I said at least when it happened it happened at a time when I could afford to get the whole tire replaced if I had to.\nAMY WENZEL: There you go. You know, can you grab the clipboard? I would love for you to write this down, just so you have a bit of a model for when you do this on your own. Okay? So.\nJOSH: On this page?\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, sure. Sure, you can do that on that page. So the situation was the tire issue.\nJOSH: Um hmm.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And then thought.\nJOSH: Broken rim.\nAMY WENZEL: Broken rim. And did you put an arrow, a lot of money?\nJOSH: Yeah. Expensive.\nAMY WENZEL: The emotion.\nJOSH: Um, anxiety.\nAMY WENZEL: And here you wrote 60 percent, is that still accurate? 60 percent?\nJOSH: Yeah. It was pretty high.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so go ahead and write 60. Alright. And so a compelling believable alternative response would be what?\nJOSH: Um, at least it happened when you could afford to replace it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so go ahead and write that down.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, before you go to the last column, let me ask you a question. When you say to yourself, \"Well, at least it happened at a time when I'm able to afford it,\" what does your anxiety level decrease to? Starts at a 60.\nJOSH: It goes down to maybe like a 20 or like a 15.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh really?\nJOSH: It's a standard financial anxiety for me.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Well that's good. Go ahead in that outcome column, go ahead and write anxiety and write 15 percent. So the outcome is what is different as a result of coming up with the alternative response. And the easiest thing to do is just to rewrite your level of anxiety. You know it could be that you do something differently. Maybe the old Josh would've freaked out and the new Josh centers himself and then does a Google search and gets the information that he needs. So that could be another outcome. So and the reason that I had you do the rating before I had you write down in the outcome column is a lot of times when people are first getting practices with these alternative response, it brings their anxiety and depression down a little bit but it's still at a fairly high level. So I actually expected you to maybe say your anxiety was at a 40 rather than a 60. My rule of thumb is that I like for the intensity of the emotion to be cut in half. So if it's not cut in half, there's probably more work to be done with the alternative response. And that alternative, so it could be, it could be something like, \"Okay, here's my plan of action. I'm gonna do a Google search and I'm gonna see that there are lots of different options for fixing it, not just replacing the entire rim.\" You know maybe that would be something that you would, you could put with it to bring your anxiety down even more. Does that make sense?\nJOSH: Yeah, it makes sense.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So as we do these with your other situations, if there are times when honestly your anxiety is not decreasing as much as half, we'll do more work with the alternative responses and so sometimes these responses even consist of two or three or even four sentences. To really get at all of the nuances and all of the aspects of the automatic thoughts that are so upsetting to people.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Well this one seems to have really done the trick for you.\nJOSH: Yeah. This could've ended up much worse.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Sure, sure. Hey let's take a look at situation number two. This was a really interesting one. You're going to your tax class and you didn't get, you didn't do as well on the exam as you wanted to.\nJOSH: No. No. Definitely not.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So when you say that you were rethinking your entire career...\nJOSH: I really wanna do taxation. So I mean it'd be like for maybe I should not go into taxation and just stick with property management or something.\nAMY WENZEL: So \"I'm not cut out for this?\"\nJOSH: Perhaps, yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. I'm gonna write that down, \"I'm not cut out for this.\" Okay. And that one, the anxiety was a seven or a 70.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

I guess I'll say 35 cause that's like the bare minimum, right?\nAMY WENZEL: Did it really and truly, do you feel that it cut it in half?\nJOSH: I don't know, probably less than that. Cause I feel, we'll do 25.\nAMY WENZEL: 25, okay. Okay.\nJOSH: But I mean he really talked us off the cliff, like he talked the entire class off the cliff.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: After the results came in.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: So I guess I know what I did do for the next one.\nAMY WENZEL: Alrighty. Alright, good. Does it help to know that other people in the class struggled and that you weren't the only one?\nJOSH: It always does. Especially when I know that Will struggled.\nAMY WENZEL: Will. Will is the benchmark.\nJOSH: But Will doesn't have the attendance I do so it might not be recoverable for him this time.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you can actually add to the alternative response, \"Other people struggled, it wasn't just me.\"\nJOSH: Yeah, I feel like I've been using that too much though.\nAMY WENZEL: What do you mean?\nJOSH: Like with some of my bad tests.\nAMY WENZEL: Hmm. So is that not a legitimate piece of information?\nJOSH: I'm starting to delegitimize it I guess. Cause it's only really my results that matter.\nAMY WENZEL: You know, and I agree with you on the one hand. I guess on the other hand though I think it can be helpful to not only know that you're not alone, but also know again that the subject matter's hard, maybe that the test was difficult. Certainly with that one professor in your other class, she tests in a difficult way that is not really on some of the material that you have in front of you.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So it's just nice from my perspective for you to know that there other factors rather than you being a failure or you not being able to do it.\nJOSH: Yeah, it's important.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So situation number three. So you eventually went for a job but you put it off all day. And this was really interesting to me because you said, \"Well, I don't like jogging and my neighbor had,\" but this was the automatic thought part; \"Everybody looks at me and judges me.\" Again.\nJOSH: Yep. Middle class suburban neighborhood.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: Too many people home in the middle of the day. I had one day off that week to do it. And it was the only day with beautiful weather. So I knew I had to go for a jog that day.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: And I finally did it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So I did everything else I needed to first. I mean everything. I avoided that till the end.\nAMY WENZEL: You avoided it. So you had some depression, some 20 percent. You were just thinking less about yourself.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: But then you asked yourself like, \"Okay, well really, if the worst happens, how bad would that be? How would I cope with it?\" How do you answer that question?\nJOSH: I would just try to jog the next day I guess. I mean it wasn't that bad cause like my diet doesn't rely on my exercise. It's just I try to use exercise to stimulate my mood.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So I guess you're saying the worst case scenario would be not jogging. Right?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: It would just be sitting at home.\nAMY WENZEL: I was thinking of a different worse case scenario. So what if somebody is looking out their window and judging you? How bad would that be?\nJOSH: Oh, weird. I don't know. I wouldn't know about it.\nAMY WENZEL: You wouldn't even know about it. Right.\nJOSH: Yeah, but it would still be weird.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: I don't know. I got into a confrontation with my somebody in my neighborhood jogging one time cause they almost hit me. So there was a little bit of anxiety there I should tell you about.\nAMY WENZEL: Anxiety there. Okay.\nJOSH: But I reported his house to the township for not having citing.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So we're even.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so there is somebody in the neighborhood who you have some tension with.\nJOSH: Yeah, I guess. If he's sober enough to remember.\nAMY WENZEL: If he's sober enough to remember. So if you're jogging, do you care about him looking out the window and seeing you?\nJOSH: No, I don't.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I just don't go down that street anymore but some people have too much time on their hands.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. I'm just curious, what do you expect them to be thinking about you?\nJOSH: I don't know. How not just that one person like anybody like, I'm like anxious about how my jog form, little things like that.\nJOSH: If I'm doing it right. Looking like a retard, jogging up and down the street.\nAMY WENZEL: So do you think there's another automatic thought, \"I might be jogging with poor form. I might be looking really silly.\"\nJOSH: Um, yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. You know it's interesting because you wrote depression here 20 percent and I think that's because you were procrastinating. But it's sounding to me like there's actually anxiety.\nJOSH: Yeah, there's anxiety but I mean a little bit of it was like I didn't feel like I had the energy to go do it either.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay and that's the part that you focused on.\nJOSH: Yeah, I thought it was like the depression part.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right and you're absolutely right about that. Although you did it so you still.\nJOSH: I did it. It wasn't a very good run. But I got out there and I did it.\nAMY WENZEL: It's okay, though. That's terrific. So I would love to work with the anxiety piece of this. Um, do you remember one of the thinking traps called mind reading?\nJOSH: Yeah, I do.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Mind reading is thinking that you know what the other person is thinking about you. And it's always negative. I don't know many people who mind read in a positive way.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. So I wonder what could you ask yourself to get some distance from the mind reading types of automatic thoughts?\nJOSH: Um, I mean like I'm on a diet cause I wanna look good so eventually when I go for a jog I want people to look at me and be like, \"Wow, he looks like he knows what he's doing.\"\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

So in the moment, when you have this idea, \"People are gonna see me, people are gonna judge me negatively.\"\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: How can you evaluate that?\nJOSH: Um, I don't know, I used to think when I used to jog a lot that if they did see me, that means they're not jogging either. They're just in their car. And at least I'm doing something.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: So it's easy to judge from sitting on a couch.\nAMY WENZEL: So that's like an alternative response. With the original automatic thoughts, \"Other people are looking at me and judging me,\" on that zero to 100 scale, how anxious does that make you?\nJOSH: I think it just depends on what kind of mood I'm in. It would be really low, especially if it's like kind of dark out like 15, 20 percent.\nAMY WENZEL: Well let's go back to that day when it was real sunny out.\nJOSH: Maybe like 40 percent.\nAMY WENZEL: 40 percent. Okay, 40/50.\nJOSH: 40 percent anxious, just but then I almost don't worry about it at all. If I could force myself to remember that.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: It's fitness and everybody has to do it.\nAMY WENZEL: It's fitness and everybody has to do it. Sure. So when you say that to yourself like, \"Well they're seeing me, that means that they're in the house or it means they're in their car and they're not working out themselves.\" Where does that bring your anxiety down to?\nJOSH: Um, down to like ten percent. Just gotta worry about the people that are jogging.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: You know, passing me.\nAMY WENZEL: Yep. You know it reminds me of something that's been circulated around email. It's a picture of a woman who doesn't look like she's terribly in shape and everybody was commenting on it and saying, \"Good for you. It takes a lot of guts to get out there and run.\" And I think the reason it's being circulated is that most people would think that the first impression would be something that was negative. But it wasn't, it was just how great is it that you're taking your fitness seriously?\nJOSH: Yeah, it's hard.\nAMY WENZEL: It is hard. And I wonder if that kind of an idea that maybe people would actually look out and just say, \"Good for you. You're doing something. You're active.\"\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Is that a possibility?\nJOSH: That's a possibility. Especially if you're just jogging for the fitness. But I think I do it to help with my depression and everything. I think I need to exercise, I think it helps me a lot.\nAMY WENZEL: It absolutely helps. And in fact, there's actually research that's being done right now that suggests that exercise is a terrific supplement to CBT.\nJOSH: Is that what I'm on, Ritalin?\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely. CBT is the type of psychotherapy we're doing, cognitive behavioral therapy. So you're really attacking depression and anxiety from a number of different avenues.\nJOSH: I am really trying to improve myself.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely.\nJOSH: I gotta be the whole package in me.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So you're taking the medicine, you're doing cognitive behavioral therapy, and we're really focusing a lot on the cognitive piece, the thinking piece. But we're also focusing on the behavioral piece, the overcoming avoidance. We're doing that mainly with the anxiety, especially about going to class and doing some of these tasks that you find aversive. But what you just brought up is something that's really important for depression. And sometimes when people are depressed they find themselves in this vicious cycle where you can follow my finger, they aren't feeling so good so they don't end up doing the things that they would normally want to do.\nJOSH: I've been down that road.\nAMY WENZEL: Exactly. So you're going around the vicious cycle.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And so you think you're kind of taking care of yourself, you think you're conserving energy by not doing these things, but you're not getting that positive effect or positive reinforcement from doing them. So then that cycles around and makes you more depressed because you're not doing the things that give you enjoyment.\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And I wonder if even that vicious cycle was also at work with your guitar playing?\nJOSH: Oh yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah.\nJOSH: Guitar just kept on building dust. And then you feel bad about the dust, you don't play it, and then it gets more dust and so on and so forth.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. So I wonder if for this, part of the alternative response is, \"Hey, if people are noticing me jogging, it means that I'm doing something to better myself and they're not necessarily doing it.\" And,\nJOSH: I would like that response.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, and you you're combating your depression, you're becoming the whole package by going out and running, even if it's not perfect.\nJOSH: Um hmm.\nAMY WENZEL: So, and how much do you believe that?\nJOSH: I believe it a lot. I believe I know everything I need to do. It's just like the doing it.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: I could be a life planner and then my life would be in shambles.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: And I'd be planning other people's lives and tell them how to do everything.\nAMY WENZEL: You know honestly it strikes me that for the vast majority of the things that you and I have talked about, you are doing, you are executing.\nJOSH: Yeah, I just don't feel, I don't know, the pressure I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. But isn't this, I mean isn't the goal to be doing things without having to do it just under pressure or under stress?\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah it is. Um. Yeah, I just wanna be more proactive.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. And do you think we're starting to achieve that here?\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely. Um, I could read \"Seven Habits of Effective People\" all day but I keep on tripping up on some of like the initial ones because of my anxiety...\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: ...stops me getting like some of the little things done and it snowballs really fast.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely.\nJOSH: So.\nAMY WENZEL: And that's exactly what we're working on in here, isn't it?\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah definitely. So I really appreciate being able to work on things like that in here.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, good. Good. And then there's a final one. This was actually probably the most intriguing to me was the going back to church. You had said in the other one, in your success log, that you hadn't been in six weeks. And I'm gathering that going to church, spirituality is quite important to you. Right?\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean my entire life it was.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah.\nJOSH: So whether I believe it now, I do. But I mean.\nAMY WENZEL: Maybe struggling.\nJOSH: It's always been important historically.\nAMY WENZEL: It's been important historically.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And are you struggling right now a little bit with whether it's currently important to you?\nJOSH: Yeah, probably. I mean I'm moving in with my girlfriend and my youth pastor said that's a bad idea.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh boy.\nJOSH: Which his view is. But it's just finding that middle ground.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, so when your youth pastor tells you that that's not the right decision, what automatic thought runs through your mind?\nJOSH: Um, that he doesn't respect me. He's like my mentor so I have a lot of respect for him. And he's helped me with a lot of things in the past.\nAMY WENZEL: Boy, when you have that idea that your youth mentor doesn't respect you, where are you on our scale of zero to 100?\nJOSH: Like 100.\nAMY WENZEL: That's anxiety or depression or both?\nJOSH: Uh, I don't know. I guess it's just a free fall for everything cause he's been there for everything, you know.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Yeah. I thought this one was a really powerful one for you. That idea that he doesn't respect you, what thinking trap is that?\nJOSH: Uh, magnification, and just not knowing. I know he loves me. As a Christian he loves me. And like he'll take me back no matter what.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Do you think you're also mind reading a little bit?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

psychological counseling dialogue:\nCurrent psychological counseling dialogue:\n```\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. And so what question could you ask in order to facilitate an alternative response?\nJOSH: Um, I don't know. Cause with him it's, it gets into more of a spiritual thing like cause he'll always love me no matter what. You know, so I guess that's kind of like a response.\nAMY WENZEL: It is.\nJOSH: It doesn't matter what you did to Dave cause Dave tries to be like Christ and always forgiving.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. And what does that do to your anxiety and depression?\nJOSH: It helps but I'm still anxious about going to see him.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right, right. And really so the automatic thought that you wrote down here is, \"I won't be welcome.\"\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean churches can be cliquey.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nAnd: you take a little hiatus from the church band and sometimes they take it personally.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So the not being welcomed at church doesn't have anything to do with moving in with your girlfriend. It has to do with leaving the band.\nJOSH: Yeah, leaving the band, probably the most part. Cause I was in that band for like six years.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. Okay.\nJOSH: And we came up from nothing and then we taught other people how to do it. And then we had three bands, we went down to one and back up to two. Um, so I think in the future what I'll probably do is just never sit in a church for more than a year because of the politics.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: It gets a little political.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so it sounds like you go to kind of a tough church. So you had this idea that you weren't gonna be welcome. But you recognized that you were jumping to conclusions.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Maybe mind reading, you know, a subset of that. So then you asked such a powerful question here, \"Does everyone's opinion really reflect that of God's opinion?\"\nJOSH: Yeah, I changed the question a little bit.\nAMY WENZEL: That's perfect. I'm glad you did that.\nJOSH: But yeah I think it's a good question.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: To ask myself.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely. What's the answer?\nJOSH: Uh no, it doesn't.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. And I'm glad that you did this because those questions that I gave you, you don't have to be tied to those questions whatsoever. You can ask any question in the world actually if it will help you to really evaluate here. So.\nJOSH: And that question's always gonna work with church related things.\nAMY WENZEL: Great. Great great. Absolutely. And so you actually did go to church.\nJOSH: Yep. Went to church. And then I talked to some of the people in the band afterwards and it was okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So did anybody give you any indication that you weren't welcome?\nJOSH: Um, I mean the drummer was mad at me during the service and didn't really say anything to me after the service. I don't know what that was about but.\nAMY WENZEL: But you don't know for sure.\nJOSH: Yeah. I worry about him.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So the other members of the band did talk to you.\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah. Some of the veterans there.\nAMY WENZEL: And were there other people in the congregation who afterwards came up to you and said how good it was to see you?\nJOSH: Um, yeah, I guess there was a few.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So what does that do to your idea that you're not welcomed?\nJOSH: I mean I guess it makes it not, I always am gonna be welcomed, just for like the spiritual aspect but... I don't know. I guess once you see some snobby things happen in church you're always worried. Who knows if they'll be pointed towards you next time?\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So it sounds like you do have some evidence, at least with other people that they've been shunned a bit. Okay.\nJOSH: Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: But other than maybe the drummer holding back a little bit from talking to you, for the most part it was a good experience.\nJOSH: Yeah. And there's like this sense in my church that once you turn like, you graduate college, you're near graduating college, you're 22, 23, you stop going. We don't have that kind of presence in our congregation at all. There's nobody my age practically.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: So being one of the few people to hang in there has its own pressure.\nAMY WENZEL: It's interesting that you call it pressure because I was actually thinking of it from a different perspective like perhaps they would welcome you even more because many of the parishioners would be so thrilled to have somebody in their early 20s attending.\nJOSH: Yeah. Maybe. I don't know, it's the, it's a contemporary service. So the parishioners aren't there. They go to the traditional service.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, oh okay. Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: It's like \"House of Cards.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So I guess then, you asked does everybody's opinion really reflect that of God's opinion and the answer was no.\nJOSH: No. Definitely not.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So the alternative response would be, what?\nJOSH: Um, it's your home church, you're still a member, you should just go and not be worried about the congregation but the reason you go to church.\nAMY WENZEL: And so what does that do to your level of anxiety? It was at 30. What does that bring it down to?\nJOSH: Oh, um maybe ten percent cause I'm still worried about the confrontation socially. But I handled it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, you handled it.\nJOSH: And having accomplishments to talk about helped a lot.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely.\nJOSH: When someone asks what you've been up to. \"You've not been playing guitar at your church?\"\nAMY WENZEL: So you have some reasons. Some things to say to them.\nJOSH: Yeah. Certainly.\nAMY WENZEL: You know the other thing I'll call your attention to, I noticed that you used the word confrontation. And a lot of people I work with who are anxious do worry about having confrontations with other people. But I wonder if somebody asking you a question like, \"Well hey, why haven't you been here?\" Does that have to be equivalent to a confrontation?\nJOSH: No. It doesn't have to be. I always turn it into one, though. I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. Well I wonder if that's, this is an example to me of the power of language. So if you say, \"Oh my goodness, there's gonna be this confrontation,\" I think that would make anybody anxious when they expect to have a blow up like that. But really more accurately, it's probably not a confrontation if somebody's just questioning why you haven't been there, right?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Do you think that language, the questioning why you haven't been there, is less loaded than the word confrontation?\nJOSH: Yeah it is less loaded. But I mean there's additives that go along with that usually. And it's usually not, \"Why haven't you been here?\" It was like, \"Hey man, it was great to see you again.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so it's not even that.\nJOSH: It's like that after you know. Like, \"Come up and give me a hug. How you been?\"\nAMY WENZEL: Right. And is that confrontational, to give a hug and say, \"Hey man?\"\nJOSH: No, it isn't.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. Alrighty. So for homework, what do you think about adding two additional columns onto your Evernote file? So you still have the situation, thought, emotion. You have the thinking trap. You have the dispute handle. Now you add on alternative response and add on the outcome.\nJOSH: Yeah. I can add those two.\n\nAMY WENZEL: And then you're willing to do the success log?\nJOSH: Yeah. I wanna keep up with the success log, probably no matter what.\nAMY WENZEL: Great. Put it together so you can see all of the bullet points accumulating.\nJOSH: Yeah, I was even thinking I would do it in Excel.\nAMY WENZEL: That's great, that's great. That's what my other client did with the 130.\nJOSH: Yeah.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Now we just have a couple of minutes left. The other thing that you said you wanted to cover at the end was the upcoming stress that you're gonna be experiencing because you have another round of midterms and finals?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, how can you apply all of our collective work together to this point in order to manage that stress?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

But I did not go to my online class and get the things I need to do off there.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Was that avoidance or procrastination?\nJOSH: That was like avoidance.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: So it's like good on one half and probably bad on the other half.\nAMY WENZEL: Alright. Well you're a work in progress, right?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Have you made a beautiful calendar before or is this the first time?\nJOSH: Um, in the beginning I used to do it before I got really depressed, I would always make calendars. So it was nice to be doing it again.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh good. So the calendar is really helpful.\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely very helpful.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you have all of the things that are due, all of the things that, and the due dates and whatnot. Should you actually write in like chunks of time to study or prepare?\nJOSH: Yeah. That's all in there.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh good.\nJOSH: I did it for all my classes except for the online class. I'm just like anxious to go on.\nAMY WENZEL: And the automatic thought is?\nJOSH: Um, I don't know, it's been too long since you went on that online class.\nAMY WENZEL: And what does that mean?\nJOSH: I'm worried I missed an assignment or something.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. And what would be so bad if you missed an assignment?\nJOSH: It's more like the online classes have the, they have the conversation post where you talk to the other students. And I missed a couple of those so like even just the social anxiety of posting online.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: It's like, \"Hey, I saw that you didn't make the last few posts. What have you been doing?\"\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. You know honestly the thing that's running through my mind is you have material right now to do the alternative response. You know what I mean? So it sounds like there's an automatic thought kind of like, \"Ah, I'm missed so much now. I'm in trouble.\" Or that things, \"I'm not gonna do as well.\" And then there's the, \"I'm gonna be judged,\" types of thoughts with the conversation type postings. Right?\nJOSH: Yeah, it's just the whole ball of anxiety. And it's silly cause it's just a blackboard page when you get down to it. It's just the blackboard page can't really hurt me.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Could you do two entries on your thought record? One for the thoughts about something going wrong with the class because you missed some assignments and second about the socially anxious thoughts. So you will have done two items for your homework right there.\nJOSH: Sure.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Do you think that the alternative responses would have the potential to help you to overcome that avoidance if you were able to keep those automatic thoughts in perspective?\nJOSH: Yeah. I'm really nervous about it but I think I could.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So you know Josh we're about out of time here.\nJOSH: Yeah, I could do this at home.\n\nAMY WENZEL: What are you ending up taking away from our work?\nJOSH: Um, we just added the columns, the alternative responses, which is something I thought we had touched on but I have another label for it.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: Um, so I'll just see if I can see how much I can improve myself until next week.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And do you think we're barking up the right tree with this?\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. The online thing is serious, I have to get that done.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you are committed to doing two entries on your thought record to get both types of thoughts that are preventing you from getting on blackboard?\nJOSH: Yeah, I mean that'll be the avoidance I'll use when I get on blackboard.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: So those two things will get done.\nAMY WENZEL: Yes, right.\nJOSH: Online class thing, I hope.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. Well what I'm hoping is by doing those two entries on your thought record, that's gonna help you get over that hump in order to really do what you need to do for the online class because you won't have as much anxiety if you come up with compelling believable alternative responses.\nJOSH: Yeah. You're definitely right.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Anything you thought I got wrong today or didn't understand?\nJOSH: Um, no, no. You usually understand.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, alright, good. Well I am back here in town next week so we will convene at the exact same time next week and I'll look forward to hearing about the online class as well as some of these other topics that we didn't get to today but certainly have implications for your future.\nJOSH: Okay that's good that you'll be checking on the online class.\nAMY WENZEL: Yes.

It's great to see you again too.\nAMY WENZEL Yeah. So I'm, I'm taking a look here at your scores, and it, it looks like they're, they're still low, but there... the anxiety: in particular was a little bit higher than it was the last couple of times I saw you.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. It definitely was.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. What would you attribute that to?\nJOSH: Um, it's like, uh, kind of crunch time for a lot of exams. It's...\nAMY WENZEL: Mm.\nJOSH: it's there, the big projects due, or like the second to last big exam's coming up,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- Uh, and so at this point, this semester we really got to get a hand on our grades,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, huh.\nJOSH: -- So,...\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, huh.\n\nJOSH: -- um, things I already kind of built, so it's a little bit more uncertain things that you need to get done.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Understandable, understandable. Do you think it's lower than it would have been... would have been had you not done this... the therapy with me?\nJOSH: Uh, yeah probably. Um, historically, my academic career,... this is like a lot of times I've like just fallen apart and just stopped going to classes at the start of the semester.\nAMY WENZEL: Really. So the crunch time when it's needed, that's... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- when you've --\nJOSH: That's why --\nAMY WENZEL: -- stopped.\nJOSH: -- my anxiety peaks the most.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So,... and that hasn't happened.\nJOSH: No it has not happened,... --\nANY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- and it's also been like really busy and stressful at work too,... --\nANY WENZEL: Oh.\nJOSH: -- before like the big renting season in my industry would be.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So getting ready for that. Uh,... --\nANY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- stressful time in my life getting ready to move too, but --\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: -- pull that together.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So, so how well do you think you're coping with all of this that's on your plate?\nJOSH: Um, I would give myself like a,... probably like a B minus,...--\nAMY WENZEL: Uh huh.\nJOSH: --just because I think there is like a... I, uh, when come to the finish line, you know, so, uh,...--\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, hm.\nJOSH: -- maybe I'm further ahead than I think,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: -- but, uh, definitely feel good about it,...--\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- a lot better than I did last year.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Good. Good. Do you think most people would function, or, or, or cope with this sort of B minus level, or, um, are there still some areas where you want to improve?\nJOSH: Um, I'm not sure if most people would, but it's kind of hard to judge how somebody else would handle your shoes,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- but,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- um, there some things that I wish I was doing better, but for the most part, like everything's on track. I just... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- I know I'm not failing, you know,...--\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- so... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Good. Good. No I asked that question, because I was wondering if it's a B, uh, been minus because of the circumstances that you're facing, or if it's a B minus, because there's been a couple of, of ways of coping that you haven't quite implemented that you otherwise might have.\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean, uh, definitely in the beginning of semester I got off to a rough start, and like one class... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: -- so, uh, I mean I definitely have been improving since then,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- and a lot of my Professors have noticed, so... --\nAMY WENZEL: Really, the Professors have actually said something.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh.\nJOSH: Uh, I mean not like... not like straight up, but, um, one of my things actually, uh, like my successes for the week, and it's also one thing in my homework,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- is I'd, uh, uh, not done as well on auditing test that I would like to have done, even though, like I, I later learnt, that nobody else did as well,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, huh.\nJOSH: -- but this time before the auditing class, um, I was able to go to the Professor before the test... --\nAMY WENZEL: Oh.\nJOSH: -- and I talked to the Professor. And that's one of the things I was really anxious about this week,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- but I went and I talked to him, and then after I finished the exam, he, uh, he told me to wait by the back door, and he checked over my exam and said that I did a good job.\nAMY WENZEL: Terrific. So that was a really different choice then you would have made in the past.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. Usually I would just probably. I don't know. I've just not gone sometimes, and just,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- you know... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- or just avoided doing it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So again, you know, this... you're experiencing some stress because of everything that's on your plate, and... --\nJOSH: Hm.\nAMY WENZEL: -- the, the end of the semester, but you're, you're coping much differently,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- because of the work that we've done.\nJOSH: Definitely.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. What did you end up taking away from the last visit?\nJOSH: Um, my last visit, I've just been, been asking myself like the alternative questions,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, hm.\nJOSH: -- you know,...--\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, hm.\nJOSH: -- um, like I, I was down, down at ISU um, it's kind of like a reward almost,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- for,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- for the, the good exam, but then when I was down there, I had some stuff to take care of to, uh, you know, you can't drive back and forth, so I was issued a couple of traffic tickets couple years, so I, I was there paying, paying off some traffic tickets,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: I was asking myself like, do these people really know that I owe them money for traffic tickets when I walk in there, like are they staring, looking me down,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, hm.\nJOSH: -- or are they, uh, are they just gonna be happy I'm there to pay it off, and now I feel good...--\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- that I paid off,...--\nAMY WENZEL: Terrific.\nJOSH: -- you know, whatever it was.\nAMY WENZEL: Terrific. So this idea of, of questioning some of your thoughts and coming up with alternative responses by an... answering the questions. It's, it's making a difference.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Excellent. What would you like to accomplish here today?\nJOSH: Um, I don't know. I'd like to talk about what we wrote about, and then I'm sure there's something else to add, or, or maybe you have a different way I could implement something.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Well I, I do have the homework printed out here. It looks like there are four items on, on your Thought Record.\nJOSH: Uh, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: You also mention the Success Log. I didn't see the Success Log...--\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- in the email.\nJOSH: I didn't send the Success Log.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So, so can we talk about that as well?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: All righty. Um, you know, and something that had come up two sessions ago, was some anxiety about this transition to this next stage of your life,... --\nJOSH: Mm.\nAMY WENZEL: -- in terms of uh, uh, getting a job on the one hand you were confident, but on the other hand you expressed some anxiety,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- as well as moving in with your girlfriend. If, if we have time for that, do you think that's something that we should... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- focus on?\nJOSH: Yeah. I've, I've made, uh, progress on one of those fronts, so we could talk about...\nAMY WENZEL: Really. Yes. Okay. Let's definitely talk about that.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. And if you think of something that's worked talking, definitely let me know,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- so we can add it to the game plan.\nJOSH: Certainly.\n\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

I've had her for a different class,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, hm.\nJOSH: -- and he's encouraged me, but he's never like said, \"hey,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, hm.\nJOSH: -- stay after the exam.\" He looked through it. Like when he gave me the exam like, I had a question about one particular problem,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, hm.\nJOSH: -- uh, and it was worth like 25% of the exams, as some of these more complicated accounting things are,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, hm.\nJOSH: -- and, uh, I had been to all the classes, but I went up to him and I said, uh, office hours the day of the test before the exam, and he's like, Josh, like I can't believe that you forgot this, uh, you know, you did one of the examples on the board last week, or you were there, and I just like... I couldn't remember how I found the answer, but I had like two hours of study for it, and he, he went over it with me and he was really, I guess, proud of me that I got it right,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Great. Great.\nJOSH: -- um.\nAMY WENZEL: So it sounds like there are a couple of aspects of this you could put on the Success Log. One was just the fact that you went to talk to him,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- rather than avoiding,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: and the other was, really you got a compliment.\nJOSH: Yeah.

I didn't really do much of the Success Log this,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- week, but... --\nAMY WENZEL: Really. So was it because there wasn't a lot that was happening, or did...,\nJOSH: I think... --\nAMY WENZEL: you lose steam?\nJOSH: When, uh, I was just so much busy. I usually do my Success Log at work, cause we get slow,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm.\nJOSH: -- but, uh,... --\nAMY WENZEL: All depends.\nJOSH: -- we, we had a busy at work, so... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Because in the past you've expressed a lot of commitment to doing the Success Log.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: It sounds like you really believe in it.\nJOSH: No, no. I mean it's still in like my EverNote --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: -- you know, with all my previous homeworks; everything I still look at it, but... --\nAMY WENZEL: Good. Now let's...\nJOSH: -- I mean I started doing one, but it just... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- I feel like if I could say the sentences better just to say... --\nAMY WENZEL: No, absolutely, absolutely. So we had talked before about the idea of putting them all together so you could see the successes in their totality... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Um. Is, is that something that happened, or no?\nJOSH: I, I didn't do that yet.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. It,... What...--\nJOSH: It's, it's something I still intend to do, but I just didn't.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. No I think that that would be terrific, because we have one more visit, three... --\nJOSH: Mm.\nAMY WENZEL: -- weeks from now, um, and it would be terrific to see the entire Success Log, because that'll really reflect a lot of our observations throughout the course of our work together, so a nice way to cap off the work.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Does that sound okay?\nJOSH: That sounds good.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. I'll, I'll enjoy looking over that again. So I'm writing down, and we'll put together a compilation.\nJOSH: Uh, mm.\n\nAMY WENZEL: But you, you were able to do the thought records, so this is... --\nJOSH: Uh, mm.\nAMY WENZEL: -- terrific, and it sounds like you've already, um, you know, talked about a couple of these situations, so... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- one was the needing... the situation was needing to go to the Audit Professor's office, and, you know, your original automatic thought was, \"he might think less of me as... of a student, or think that I wasn't paying attention in class, and you were pretty anxious... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: of a level of 75. Um,... --\nJOSH: I was just really anxious about going in.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. So the alternative response was, \"well he's gonna think more for me... of me for coming in to see him before\"... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- the exam. Okay. How did you arrive upon that alternative response?\nJOSH: Um, I had to convince somebody else to come with me, and that's what I told them. I told Will, because Will was there with me starting out. I know I bring him up a lot, and I even told him about that the other day. I said I bring you up sometimes, and he said, \"it's okay.\" But I went there... I actually went to his office twice, cause after the first time, I still didn't get it.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh.\nJOSH: And Will didn't get it either, and he had been with me to the office... I was the first time, but I went... I even went back a second time.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh my God. Double success.\nJOSH: Yeah. Double success.\nAMY WENZEL: Did Will go with you the second time?\nJOSH: No he didn't. He was start at... --\nAMY WENZEL: Really.\nJOSH: the end. He didn't go in the door.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: He stood outside the office. The Professor never saw him.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I mean that really cemented in my mind that like, yeah, it was good to go in.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. So even before that,... even before you had the evidence that it was good to go in. Um, you know, when you have this idea that he thinks less of me of... as a student, what... how did you question that in order to get distance from that?\nJOSH: Um, I don't know. It's just I'm running out of alternatives of what to do, so I guess I just... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- I had like a specific goal that I was able to go after it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So it kind of sounds like you were thinking about what's the most effective thing... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- that I, I need to do, and this was the answer.\nJOSH: Yeah. But I mean, there's like a success there too, but the, the problem I was having even before this, our therapy was like, like the... I would have put on the Success Log maybe a year ago I went to class,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- is, um, you know, not on the Success Log this week, or that I went to my Law class on Monday,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: but I don't get... I don't have like the same anxiety about going to it.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: Um, so I didn't put it on the Success Log...(crosstalk) --\nAMY WENZEL: So the magnitude of it being a... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- success would have been greater before, because the anxiety and avoidance were so much more entrenched.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. And I... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- think now I... there's probably less things... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I'm definitely there.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Good. And then the other situation that we've talked about was going to pay off the old bill, which was a traffic... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: tickets.\nJOSH: Yeah. I'd go into McClean County Circuit Court... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And it's interesting, because you said here well there wasn't really a negative thought. You were just nervous, but it sounds like, you know, you focused on the fact that having an item off of your credit score is really important, and... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: so I wonder if there's a sense there that your credit score was in jeopardy.\nJOSH: I have taken care of a couple of things, um, these past few months off my credit score. I saw that I was in jeopardy, but as my job,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Right.\nJOSH: -- uh, then I'm applying for jobs, so a lot of the theme for, I guess today and next week, will be that transition like we said,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: -- and that it all comes back to that, I'm, just... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: -- straightening everything out, you know.\nAMY WENZEL: So maybe a vague sense there that this could, um, be a bump in the road in the transition.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. But then you kind of focused on the alternative, like look... like taking care of this is actually gonna really benefit my credit score.\nJOSH: Mm. Yeah. It might, might push it up or just... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- not start dragging it down as much. I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Now you said something else interesting when you were telling me about this before, that you, you said yourself just walking in there doesn't mean that they have... the people are looking at you sternly.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So did you have the automatic thought that you were gonna be judged negatively by the clerks?\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- just walking in that building, I guess,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- and, and, uh, McClean County has,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: is not fun to do. Going into any Court House isn't fun to do,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: -- but,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: -- I mean especially if, if you did something wrong and you need to go back and pay for it.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: But I was down at Eye Issue, and I had a friend with me, and, uh, we went together, so... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: He didn't go in the building with me, but it was definitely easy,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: -- easier to go there with a friend.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So the original thought was that I'm gonna be judged negatively,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- and then the alternative response was, what?\nJOSH: Um, just do it and get the hell out of there, is the last thing I have to do in that building,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- and then I'm, I'm out of blue into normal.\nAMY WENZEL: To see you focused on how good it would feel to... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: --to be done.\nJOSH: Yeah. I'm out of that town.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I never have to go back there...(crosstalk) --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: --if I don't want to so... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. Assuming you don't get any more tickets... --\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- I assume.\nJOSH: I'm driving through to Springfield or something, I'll probably get one.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. And it sounds like then you also said, 'Well they don't have to look at me sternly. Like they could actually be happy I'm coming here to take responsibility to pay it off.\"\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah, that's true.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And, and again this did the trick and brought your anxiety down from a 30 to a five.\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\n\nAMY WENZEL: So there are a couple of other situations that we haven't yet talked about. One was going to JCC Library to study.\nJOSH: Yeah. Joliet Junior College. I might have spelt that wrong.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So Joliet Junior College, and thought was, \"everyone knows I'm not a student there.\" And I, I guess, what, what does that mean?\nJOSH: Sometimes I just have anxiety going, into like the social setting, but I mean... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- going to like the library. I look older than most of like the, the students who are there.\nAMY WENZEL: So again, does it come down to being judged somehow negatively by... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- others.\nJOSH: Yeah. It comes down to being judged... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- differently.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So I'm gonna be judged negatively. Your anxiety was at a 40, and then your alternative response was what?\nJOSH: Uh, it was, um, \"well like Governor State University is a upper division school, so it's only Juniors and Seniors.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. Okay.\nJOSH: JJC is a lower division school, so if were in one school, they would be like freshman.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: I started thinking of all as like freshman.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: That was like my alternative response,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- I guess, was they're all freshmen.\nAMY WENZEL: So meaning you outclass them, you're kind of more the big, big guy on campus. --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Okay.\nJOSH: I'm done with whatever classes they're taking.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. Okay. And that really brought you're an... anxiety way down from a 40... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- to a 10.\nJOSH: Yeah. It gave me a little bit of an attitude too, but it was okay. I didn't talk to anybody.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Was it an attitude that ended up being okay, that, that kind of made you go and...\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Okay. I deserve my side there.\nAMY WENZEL: Rather than an attitude that causes problems.\nJOSH: Yeah, or just not being able to focus as much while... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- there.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Good. Good. And then a final situation was, you were researching your student loan payment options, and you said you were worried about payments and money, so again, what does that boil down to? What automatic thought?\nJOSH: Um, I just wanna have the money.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. That... --\nJOSH: I mean more... Yeah. I would like, it's easy talking to you about what my anxieties are,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- judgement and money and some of the other popular things like, I guess,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- people my age, but... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: uh, you hear it on the news every day, suit at Low and Bubble, uh, what's Obama gonna do, but you never know. I just I, I imagine me and a lot of other college students feel that when we walk out of graduation, like a big piano's gonna fall on our head, you know.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. So big piano fall on the head. Okay.\nJOSH: Uh, that's what it feels like sometimes.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: cause I, uh, part of my anxiety is I,... is I almost turn myself into like a non-traditional student.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: Um, so I definitely have a lot of student loan debt--\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- but I'm also in a good position to get a job and pay for it.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.(crosstalk)\nJOSH: And that's why... --\nAMY WENZEL: And that was your alternative response.\nJOSH: That was my alternative response.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely. Absolutely. I'm, I'm pretty employable, and I... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: like the idea that you can defer the payments as needed. Now I understand that that's not gonna be your first choice,... --\nJOSH: No,... --\nAMY WENZEL: but... --\nJOSH: -- it certainly isn't.\nAMY WENZEL: -- there's an option to bail you out if you need it.\nJOSH: Yeah. Uh, and it's not definite that I could that, but it's... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- reassuring.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. Terrific. Terrific job with this.\nJOSH: Thank you.\n\nAMY WENZEL: So, so now you have a good sense of my process of thought modification; how to really recognize those key automatic thoughts that are causing anxiety or other types of emotional distress, and coming up with a softer or a more balanced way of looking at it. Um, how useful do you think this is gonna be moving forward?\nJOSH: I think it's very useful moving forward.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: Um, it's useful in like, my personal life. Uh, it's useful in my relationship, and it's annoying to my girlfriend, cause she has anxiety too admittedly.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: Admittedly.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: She's, she's like, \"I, I know I get anxious sometimes,\"... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Okay.\nJOSH: The thought I figure your own anxiety.\nAMY WENZEL: So not only are you practicing with your own automatic thoughts, but when your girlfriend gets anxious, it sounds like you're educating her about this process.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: She claims she knows, but... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: You know, I, I do find that there's a difference between people saying, oh, yeah, I know, versus laying it out systematically like you're doing.\nJOSH: Mm.\nAMY WENZEL: I found that I, I called this the Ya, Ya, Ya Syndrome, meaning that when people say, yes I know I do this, yet they start to say, oh, yeah, yeah, I know that there's evidence against it, or yeah, yeah, I know that's only the worst case scenario, but they don't actually reason it through in the way that you do,... --\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: -- so they never come up with a really compelling or believable alternative response.\nJOSH: Yeah. No they don't.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. Would you be willing, um, to continue to do this at least for one more time in between... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: on our last visit?\nJOSH: Yeah. That's fine.\nAMY WENZEL: Because what we're doing is, is we're really solidifying a new habit for you, so... --\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: -- you know, the old habit was jumping to conclusions, doing the mind reading, kind of focusing on the worst case scenario. The, the new habit is thinking in a balanced way, by really questioning and making sure you're looking at everything that goes into a situation, and that habit really becomes more and more entrenched just with the practice.\nJOSH: Yeah. No, I agree. Um, like, like I said, I've mentioned it before, like I've read some Malcolm Gladwell books, and like the All Seven Effective... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: Habits and everything,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- but I've always just had like this like little speed bump just like aside from me implementing some of the things,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- I'm just going ya, ya, ya, but the anxiety... eventually doing some of those things have been difficult,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: -- so I always feel like I'm always being enabled to do other things as well.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Because of that, that avoidance that goes a long with the anxiety,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- and procrastination,... --\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: -- so then you kind of get reinforced when you're able to do some of these other things.\nJOSH: Yeah. It's gonna make other positive habits easier.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. So you're paving the way.\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. No that's, that's terrific. That's terrific.\nJOSH: Yeah.\n\nAMY WENZEL: The other thing I think that could've been an obstacle in the past is that you didn't really like writing things down, but my sense is that the two of us really found a nice outlet for you to get some... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- of this down on paper, or at least electronically, in order to go through it systematically rather than dismissing it in your mind.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. It's definitely been an organization process... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- these past few weeks,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- but, uh, --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- I mean the fact like you were very open to me using Over... Evernote,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, huh.\nJOSH: I've always been able to just add stuff when I've... when I've had my phone or my laptop.\nAMY WENZEL: Exactly. It needs to be convenient, so... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- more and more of the clients in my practice are actually using Apps, or using a notes function like... --\nJOSH: Mm.\nAMY WENZEL: -- that than rather writing things down on paper.\nJOSH: Yeah. One day they'll be the Wenzel app and you'll just upload right to your phone.\n\nAMY WENZEL: That would be nice. That would be nice. So now what about this transition. Tell me the pieces about the transition that are, uh, making you anxious as well as the new development that you talked about.\nJOSH: Um, part of the anxiety, I guess I wanna say is moving in with my girlfriend. I think everybody my age would have that anxiety,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, huh.\nJOSH: -- no matter how long you've been dating. Uh, one of my mentors, uh, from Church, uh, told me not to do it.\nAMY WENZEL: Was this the person you were referring to last time?\nJOSH: Uh, probably.\nAMY WENZEL: Your Youth Group leader.\nJOSH: Yeah my Youth Group... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, huh.\nJOSH: -- Pastor.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Uh,...\nAMY WENZEL: Dave.\nJOSH: Yeah, Dave.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: He told me it was a bad idea,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- in God's eyes.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Um, society eyes not so much,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- but it's still something to consider. Um, there's a little bit of financial risk going into it, as, uh, my girlfriend's buying a condo, and I'm in all legal terms her first tenant, as her... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- you know, co-roommate,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm.\nJOSH: -- just paying for my half, but still in her name, so... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Mm, hm.\nJOSH: Uh, my family is a little concerned about that, but... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Are, are you concerned?\nJOSH: Um, no. Cause I think we wanna get married.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: It's kind of a gamble. If you don't have to get married, you lose your equity. It's basically like that,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- It's like a weird situation, but... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- I'm a young guy. I'm probably have to rent either way, so... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I kind of just miss that.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So that, that's the alternative response. It's like, well, I wouldn't be building equity anyway,...\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: because I'm running one way or another.\nJOSH: Yeah. Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: So you might as well take the gamble on the relationship to see if that works.\nJOSH: Yeah. And a part of that stress is moving from, you know, a smaller suburb into the city, the big... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- big city, using public transportation to go everywhere,... --\nJOSH: -- being able to get to work.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Getting a job is the most stressful thing.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And getting a job.\nJOSH: But, but the, the development that I mentioned is, uh, I've just got all these tools, you know. Um, my girlfriend sent me a bunch of spreadsheets. There is ton... there's always been information available to me like Career Services at University Centers, but... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- I mean, uh, I'm feeling like happy enough to be able to put it together now.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: So...\nAMY WENZEL: So it sounds like maybe before you, you avoid it or procrastinated it a bit,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- even though you had these services available,... --\nJOSH: Mm.\nAMY WENZEL: and now you're in a much better place emotionally, so... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- you're taking advantage.\nJOSH: Yeah. It's easier,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- it's, uh, to write good things about yourself.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: -- If, uh, if you're feeling good about yourself.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. I think you're learning how to give yourself credit without disqualifying the positive. Maybe the Success Log actually is partially... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: responsible for that.\nJOSH: Yeah. Definitely. I used to disqualify the positive a lot,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely.\nJOSH: -- Of course I didn't use that word in my head... ---\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: -- when I did it,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: -- so... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. So, so you actually mentioned four different pieces of the anxiety about the transition. So one was what your Youth Pastor, Youth Group Pastor said about it being a bad idea in... --\nJOSH: Mm.\nAMY WENZEL: God's eyes. There's a financial risk, although it sounds like you've reconciled that.\nJOSH: Yeah. Done that.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Okay. So the logistics.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And then, you know, a bit of anxiety about getting, getting the job.\n\nJOSH: Oh. Uh, probably most anxiety about actually getting the job.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So should we focus on that one first?\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Absolutely.\nJOSH: Because even if I - I'll, I'll be able to move in my girlfriend's place, no problem.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: But I don't want to be there all day, every day,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- with nothing to do.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: -- not be able to support... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- my half.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Mm, hm. Okay. So what is your plan for, for getting a job?\nJOSH: Um, just another resume, just...\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: I got an App on my phone that tells me every day when there's job openings available.\nAMY WENZEL: Really!\nJOSH: Yeah. It's, it's a Glassdoor App. It gives your ratings of other companies. Um,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- any major can use it.\nAMY WENZEL: I guess when, when they say there's an App for everything, they really... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- mean there's an App for... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- everything.\nJOSH: No there really is.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Um, I got a couple of contacts in my accounting industry.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: but,...\nAMY WENZEL: So you... have you sent out any resumes yet?\nJOSH: No. Definitely a lot of anxiety associated.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: If you wanted to make a, um, something to check on next meeting, would be... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- if you had sent out any resumes or not.\nAMY WENZEL: Can, can we write that down for homework?\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. You can definitely write that down.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I need somebody to ask me.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: It helps if you're gonna ask.\nAMY WENZEL: I'm, I'm putting three stars here, to, to remind myself of that.\nJOSH: But it's just like the... it's the judgement thing all over again, I guess, when it comes down to it; it's just putting yourself out there.\nAMY WENZEL: Really! Let me ask you this. Um, a couple of sessions ago you said that you even, um, have trouble getting to the resume. I don't think you had actually had the resume together,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- but now do you, or... --\nJOSH: I have fixed the computer that it was on,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: and I found the resume, but I mean, it still needs to be updated.\nAMY WENZEL: It still needs to be updated.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And are you avoiding that?\nJOSH: Definitely avoiding that.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. When you think about sitting down to, to do the resume, what runs through your mind?\nJOSH: Immediately like calculate my GPA for me, la... last couple of semesters.\nAMY WENZEL: Are you a little scared to see what that would be?\nJOSH: A little bit, but there's a lot of ways to frame... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- your GPA. Like my GPA GSU is higher than it was at Eye Issue, so I can put... --\nAMY WENZEL: Good.\nJOSH: -- my GSU GPA... --\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, sure, sure.\nJOSH: I could just put the GPA from my accounting classes, so I'm... I already have like reconciling thoughts for that, but I still haven't been able to do it.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Mm, hm. And how do you explain that, that you haven't been able to do it?\nJOSH: I just... I'm just anxious about it, I guess; just the sitting down.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So, so what I'm trying to pinpoint is what's running through your mind that's really making you so anxious. So, you know, one hypothesis was that you didn't want to face the GPA, but you have reconciled that.\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: What else is it?\nJOSH: It's just the doing, I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Any thoughts like, um, this isn't gonna work. I'm not gonna be able to get a job?\nJOSH: Well I have one concern, is that I'm an IDS major, and I'm not a direct accounting major, even though my minor's in accounting,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: and I've taken all the accounting classes, except for the computer accounting classes an, an accounting... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: major would take, but I used to be an Information Systems Major,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- so I have the computer classes on the Information Systems side,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- but because I wanted to graduate as early as possible, was what I told my counselor,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- she said to do the IDS major, and I'd get out of here like a year earlier.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. And that's Inter Disciplinary Studies.\nJOSH: Yeah, Inter Disciplinary Studies.\nAMY WENZEL: So do you have the belief that because you're Inter Disciplinary Studies, that you're gonna be overlooked for some jobs, or not... --\nJOSH: I might.\nAMY WENZEL: -- be qualified?\nJOSH: I might be overlooked for some jobs, but I'm certainly over-qualified for a lot of different jobs,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- or I'm perfectly qualified for a lot of things.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: Um,...\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. How can they find out if that's true?\nJOSH: I mean, you really can't. I already asked like this kind of newer idea,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- but I mean, my girlfriend's, my people with IDS degrees in her job, and a lot of people will just take it to me in that you took whatever classes you wanted to that interested you, so... --\nAMY WENZEL: So it doesn't have to equal some... being something bad?\nJOSH: No it doesn't.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: You can kind of makeup whatever it is, basically.\nAMY WENZEL: So when you say that to yourself, that your girlfriend knows people who are IDS majors, um, that it doesn't have to equal being bad, does that reduce your anxiety?\nJOSH: It reduces my anxiety, but I still don't know how I'm gonna be able to, to pull it together. As, as soon I sit down to do my resume, I'll think, oh, you, you study for this or work on this test.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: -- I'm more focused on... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- graduating right now.\nAMY WENZEL: Well, yeah. So, so,... I mean there is three weeks in between our visits. Um, when are your finals actually done?\nJOSH: May 8th is the last one.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, boy. Okay.\nJOSH: So it is... it is --\nAMY WENZEL: And I'm gonna be back,... --\nJOSH: ...a little while.\nAMY WENZEL: so you, you're gonna still be the thick of everything. Here was where I was going with this in my mind. I was wondering if you should just give yourself permission to work on the resume after your finals are done, so you're just focusing on one thing at, at a time.\nJOSH: Perhaps. I get a lot of pressure from my girlfriend to work on my resume.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: Um,... --\nAMY WENZEL: So do you... --\nJOSH: maybe it's her anxiety too about me getting a job.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure.\nJOSH: It's probably that.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. Sure. So what would be the advantages of trying to tackle the resume now along with everything associated with your classes?\nJOSH: Um, sooner employment after graduation,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- which is kind of an ultimate goal of independence.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- But, um,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Those are important things.\nJOSH: -- and a lot of jobs will take a month or two to get back to you before your final... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: mind those, you know,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- all the systems they go through, and they count the... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: -- words on your resume, and on and on and on.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. What are the disadvantages o... of doing that, or what would be the advantages of, of waiting until all your classes are done?\nJOSH: I'd probably be able to focus on my classes better,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

template based on the current psychological counseling dialogue:\nCurrent psychological counseling dialogue:\n```\nAMY WENZEL: Mm.\nJOSH: I don't know. I guess that's a worry.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Mm, hm. And do you think that anxiety is going to be worse now when you're juggling a whole bunch of things or classes, or might it actually be worse after you've taken your last final? Will you have time for yourself, and have time to be in your head?\nJOSH: Um, honestly both those things you said sound terrifying.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So there's going to be anxiety either way.\nJOSH: Yeah. There's going to be anxiety either way.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: So I'm just trying to cope with that.\nAMY WENZEL: So do you think the advantages of starting now outweigh the advantages of waiting, or did the out... the advantages of waiting outweigh the advantages of starting now?\nJOSH: I think starting now would probably be better.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Uh,...\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I think for preparation always beats opportunity, but... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Preparation, sure. So there sounds like we need to figure out a way to overcome some of this avoidance, given that there's always gonna be something else to deal with... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- another fire to put out.\nJOSH: Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Any ideas?\nJOSH: No. I have been using like the Reward System... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: weekly, but, um, I've been off my diet the past week, so when I went and did that thing in McClean County, and paid off the bill, we went to Taco Bell afterwards to try like the new breakfast. There's like a little reward and everything.\nAMY WENZEL: Aha, Aha.\nJOSH: Um, but I can't do that all the time, cause I'll get really fat.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. So you can't do that... --\nJOSH: I just,...\nAMY WENZEL: all the time.\nJOSH: you know, I'm gonna go back on my diet soon and hopefully,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: -- you know. Friday I'd like to... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. Right. I do want to point out, though, um, sure you've been off of your diet, but you're getting right back on, so you're really refraining from falling into the trap of all or nothing thinking; kind of like, oh, I went off the wagon,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- why don't I just stay off? I mean, you're getting right back on.\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: So it's kind of the same thing with the resume. So even if one day you have the idea that you're gonna do it, and then you end up not doing it, it doesn't mean you have to put it off indefinitely. There's always another day.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: Yeah. Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So with the Reward System, rewarding yourself with food, it sounds like we wanna steer clear, given that you also... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- have this goal of, of resuming your diet.\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: Yeah. I can't... I mean I'm big like craft beer enthusiast, and that doesn't work either on the diet.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: So, uh, I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: I don't know what kind of Reward System,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Well, you know, maybe the Reward System isn't the answer. Um, another thing that I'm thinking about is last time you were telling me you developed a pretty elaborate calendar,\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right?\nJOSH: Yeah. Got a calendar going.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Yeah. And for the most part, other than your online class, you were sticking to the calendar, right?\nJOSH: Yup.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So what if you were to work in a bit of time to work on the resume?\nJOSH: Um, I've done that before... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: Um, but, yeah, it's something... it's something that I'd ever try again,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- that didn't work last time.\nAMY WENZEL: So it didn't work. What happened? It was just easy to... --\nJOSH: I just, uh,... --\nAMY WENZEL: put on!\nJOSH: decided I needed to spend extra time on something else instead,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- you know, double check those answers.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Mm, hm. Um, do you think it would be important to cut... to have it in your mind a list of reasons why it's important to do your resume now in order to motivate you in the moment?\nJOSH: Yeah. Definitely. If really my girlfriend sends me that list like every day.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. What's on that list?\nJOSH: Uh, I mean she's just like, here's all these tools and resources.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: And she sends me like a resume builder, and she sent me her resume, and...\nAMY WENZEL: So she's given you the tools and resources, um, which are helpful, uh.\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean that was just today, and that... I think that was a positive development.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Yeah.\nJOSH: -- of what I was saying earlier, so I'm definitely in a good spot to do it now.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But I have been for a while.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So, so humor me for a second. The reasons why it's important to do this now are what? Let's list them.\nJOSH: Um, to apply for a job.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. And why is that important?\nJOSH: Uh, to gain independence.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Getting independence. Number two, why's it important?\nJOSH: Uh, I guess it would... it would just be gaining independence across the board. It would just be the only reason to do... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- the resume.\nAMY WENZEL: Well, and I think, you know, if we look at gaining independence more specifically,... so there's a general, I, I understand... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: the general concept, but you wanna be able to pay your share of the, the mortgage.\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: Earning income.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Mm, hm. And I remember you saying some things like, regarding your girlfriend's father, that, um, he seems to really wanna see you to take the next step, in order to... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- the relationship to the next step.\nJOSH: Yeah. He does.\nAMY WENZEL: Would that be another reason?\nJOSH: Yeah. That would be a reason,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: to do it for him.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Would there be any other reasons to start now?\nJOSH: Um, just to have plenty of time to work on it.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: So...\nAMY WENZEL: So it's not so under the gun so you could really refine... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- it and...\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: um, you know,... --\nJOSH: make multiple copies for different positions.\nAMY WENZEL: Make multiple copies. Sure. Sure. You know, what about, you know, just giving you more financial security. The earlier you get a job, um, the sooner you get a job, the more money you'll be making.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: Definitely. And to be able to quit my current job.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. So it's another... to be able to quit your job.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: So... --\nAMY WENZEL: All right.\nJOSH: -- So I guess those would be the reasons.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Those five reasons, do, should we write them down?\nJOSH: Yeah. Sure.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nJOSH: Very good job; quit current job; --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- financial security; --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: independence; --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: Um, time to improve. Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: And, and paying mortgage. Right!\nJOSH: Yeah. I'm paying mortgage. I'm so old.\nAMY WENZEL: And, and kind of taking the next step, um, in, in your girlfriend's father's eyes, um, I think you were saying it would help him have more confidence in the relationship.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Got it.\nAMY WENZEL: So how... realistically how helpful do you think this list is gonna be in the moment when you're really feeling this need to avoid?\nJOSH: Uh, if I have it on me that will be good.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Where you gonna keep that then?\nJOSH: I'll probably just keep it in my laptop sleeve. Probably the best place.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: But, um, these lists... lists like this have happened before.\nAMY WENZEL: Exactly. And you could... you could put this into another Evernote file.\nJOSH: Yeah.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

about having your laptop with you.\nJOSH: Yeah. You're right.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Now let me ask you a question, and, and with your girlfriend, you don't really, you know, expressing a lot that she wants you to get a job soon and start on a resume.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Does that at all put more pressure on you, or do you experience that adversively?\nJOSH: Um. Yeah. I definitely aversively, but sometimes like I know it makes me really happy when I've accomplished one of those things too,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: So... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: when I accomplish one of those things, she's always telling me like the next step,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: of what to do, so... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Is there a part of you that's wanting to start this first to please her, rather than please yourself?\nJOSH: Yeah. Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Most of the things I do are to please her, probably.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And are you, you okay with... --\nJOSH: Or it's not to please her. I shouldn't say that.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: It's to please, like, uh, my future. My future, I think involves her,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- so...\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Is this an issue that we need to discuss, or are you okay with this.?\nJOSH: I'm, I'm okay with that.\nAMY WENZEL: You're okay with it.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Our relationship is solid.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, I know, it sounds...(crosstalk) --\nJOSH: I don't have any anxiety.\nAMY WENZEL: -- like it if you're considering marriage.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: The reason I even brought it up, it's just, um, it's always my wish for my clients that their motivation really comes from within, at least primarily from within,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: rather than being driven by the expectations of other people.\nJOSH: Yeah. My, my main motivation is to improve myself.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: In fact I heard a great quote the other day, um,... --\nAMY WENZEL: What was the quote?\nJOSH: I think you'll like. Uh, it was, \"the best revenge is success.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Uh.\nJOSH: So if you really want to stick it to somebody, which I do, cause one of my old colleagues from my business fraternity was just, uh, just got a deal from Mark Cuban, from Shark Tank.\nAMY WENZEL: Really!\nJOSH: Yeah, and I, I thought of the horrible idea and I told him that,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- and that we've had a big falling out. He actually told me not to date my current girlfriend.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. Goodness.\nJOSH: Um, so I mean.,. I just, that the best revenge is to be successful.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. Right. You know, what I,... what I like about what you just said is, is you know, it's kind of a funny, funny phrase, but really, you're, you're, you're focusing on yourself and what you can do to better yourself,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- rather than being angry or resentful towards him and his success... --\nJOSH: Mm.\nAMY WENZEL: -- and what not.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yup. Yup. So... --\nJOSH: I do.\nAMY WENZEL: He's gonna be successful, but so what, so are you.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So I've,... should you write that down there? The best revenge is being successful.\nJOSH: No I got that in my head.\nAMY WENZEL: You have it in your...\nJOSH: I've been telling that to everybody.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I didn't write that one down.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So, so when you're at home and you have other assignments to do and what not, you know, could you, you know, not really focus not only on these reasons, but this, you know, drive to be successful.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And sometimes if you're lost by a full buddy,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- it's healthy.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. So, and when you write, it sounds a little bit spiteful, but it sounds like you're making it work for you, rather than bring you down or...\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Were, were you ruminating on it?\nJOSH: Try not to be angry.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So, so the resume was, you know, one piece of the anxiety associated with getting a job.\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: What's... what are the other pieces of anxiety associated with getting a job?\nJOSH: Um, Job Fairs; Job Fairs. I've been to four, five of them.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, yeah.\nJOSH: I felt post Job Fairs before.\nAMY WENZEL: You...\nJOSH: I've met, met the employers... --\nAMY WENZEL: Oh.\nJOSH: from my business fraternity... helped them set up their tables.\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, huh.\nJOSH: uh, terrified of going though, waiting in those lines, shaking their hands, had a little... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: name tag on me, doing a 30 second elevator speech,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: uh, I helped with workshops that teach people how to get jobs after college,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Really!\nJOSH: -- how to dress for interviews,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Uh, huh.\nJOSH: -- um, absolutely terrified to do it myself.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Do you have Job Fairs coming up?\nJOSH: Um, I'm not sure if GSU is a Job Fair or not. I'm not really counting on going to one, cause I'm terrified of 'em. I think I'm... --\nAMY WENZEL: You know what's interesting? I think GSU is having a Job Fair, because I think I saw the sign,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: on, on my way in here.\nJOSH: Yeah. Um, I'd rather go back to Eye Issues Job Fair, uh, and say I just graduated there and lie to everybody.\nAMY WENZEL: Uh.\nJOSH: I don't know. I don't think GSU is quite the academic pull,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- for the kind of job I'm looking for.\nAMY WENZEL: It sounds like regardless though, you're, uh, gonna be focused on Job Fairs. Is that right?\nJOSH: I'm focused on submitting applications in person and online.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm. Mm, hm. So that's different than a job fair.\nJOSH: That's different than a job fair. Yeah. I'm going to be focused on the connections I already have in the accounting industry... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- first. That's my first.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: So I'm going to take care of that. That doesn't work.\nAMY WENZEL: So then do you and I even need to deal with Job Fairs or no?\nJOSH: No. No. Let's not deal with Job Fairs.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. I do wanna ask a question... --\nJOSH: is a...\nAMY WENZEL: though before... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: we table it.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Are we not dealing with Job Fairs because you have an abundance of all these other connections, or is it a bit of avoidance as well?\nJOSH: Um, probably both, but we're going to try alternatives where I'll be more confident at first.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. You know what, what a good reframe.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: That's a great way of looking at it.\nJOSH: And then if at the end of the day I'm going to Job Fairs, uh,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: that's what it's gotta be.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: So...\nAMY WENZEL: And, and honestly, it kind of seems to me if you do have to go to a Job Fair, the automatic thoughts are gonna boil down to... I'm gonna be judged negatively, or seen negatively,... --\nJOSH: Yeah. Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: And we've been talking about how to deal with that. Right?\nJOSH: Yeah. We have been.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So after the resume then, you are going to then be submitting applications for jobs that you get from this App. Is that right?\nJOSH: Um, well I mean there's... I mean it's the Internet nowadays, and there's all sorts of... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: you know, things online in. Uh, each company has a career link on their main page like Stayfoam and Caterpillar.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. Okay.\nJOSH: Any of those big companies, and you have to go through... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- their system,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- upload your resume and then on their form type in your references and your previous work and then just... it's just a really ... they make it, you know, a difficult form to fill... I mean it's not... it's not something you could do in 10 minutes... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

dialogue:\n```\nAMY WENZEL: Really! So, so it takes... --\nJOSH: --it takes time.\nAMY WENZEL: -- some time... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- but at least all everything's right there. Uh, we don't have to submit a lot of paper and go to the...\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: Post Office and mail.\nJOSH: Yeah. But it's very easy to avoid, because you're on the Internet,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: -- and so there's one page you have all your friends that you've ever known, and on the next page, you have the one... the last thing that you wanna do.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. Good observation.\nJOSH: And on the other pages even better things.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right. Right. Okay. So what does that suggest to you then?\nJOSH: Um, that, uh, I get too easily distracted on the Internet, I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Well I think most people do. I... I'm just wondering if when you're on the Internet applying for jobs, maybe you don't have any other tabs open on the Internet.\nJOSH: Oh, yeah. Yeah, we could try that.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: I had more than one screen going at a time when I'm on the Internet. I used to be an Information Systems major.\nAMY WENZEL: That's right. That's right.\nJOSH: I had the Internet working of my zoo.\nAMY WENZEL: So, should... so should we say one screen only?\nJOSH: Yeah. Maybe.\nAMY WENZEL: That rule. Okay. Okay. Okay.\nJOSH: One Hardrive only.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: One CPU.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: Uh,...\nAMY WENZEL: So it sounds like there are, are just some things that, you know, in your environment that you can set up to really optimize this.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So...\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And a huge reward I'm using for this week is the game of Thrones Premier on Sunday.\nAMY WENZEL: Terrific. I'm a game of Thrones fan too.\nJOSH: Yeah. So if, uh,...\nAMY WENZEL: Mm.\nAMY WENZEL: You're gonna have to wait.\nJOSH: I gonna have to wait.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Tha... that is... those are perfect rewards, so earlier... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- you were saying you were having trouble identifying rewards.\nJOSH: Yeah, but Thrones hasn't been out yet.\nAMY WENZEL: Hasn't been out yet, but it will be.\nJOSH: So now I have one every Sunday.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. You'll have one every Sunday for about 10 weeks.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Probably.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Which is perfect, because that's 10 weeks through the end of the semester,... --\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: -- where you need to be focusing on your classes, and 10 weeks of, you know, some where you're upping the, the job search frame.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Um, do you think some of these motivational statements and, uh, have reasons to complete your resume will also be good reasons to focus on one screen, you know, with...--\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: a job application?\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean they all are good reasons, but it's more... --\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: -- or less just developing, uh, a positive habit.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: So I really picked up that these last few weeks,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: -- and I mean, uh, definitely reoccurring things.\nAMY WENZEL: So, so, would it be too rigid to say, you know, have the idea of doing one thing for the job search every day, one and only one, so you don't have to get overwhelmed, but you doing something.\nJOSH: Yeah. No it wouldn't be too rigid at all.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Um, so, so for the first several days it might be doing an aspect of your resume.\nJOSH: Mm.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. But then after, would it be what, applying for one job or that... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- or would that be too much, given how involved they are?\nJOSH: Writing a cover letter.\nAMY WENZEL: Writing a cover letter.\nJOSH: Stuff like that. Uh,...\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. You know, here's, here's I think what might be a useful homework assignment, uh, exercises. Um, maybe making a list of all of the things that you need to do for the jobs, then, or for the job search, so then you're, you're gonna be able pick and choose each day which task or which part of a task to do.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: So in fact I'm actually gonna write all of your homework on my sheet. So we still have the Thought Record.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: We still have the Success Log.\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: And, you know, the list of tasks for the job search. Right.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And for sure, by the next time I see you, you want that, that resume to be done if not sent, starting... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: -- to be sent out.\nJOSH: At least be submitted to one job. One submission.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So resume submitted to one job.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And say if I could organize my life and make my own tasks and then have somebody else do them.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: I'd be President right now.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: Once I was 35.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. But remember.. I mean again. The Success Log's going to be a great resource for you, cause there were a number of times you and I talked about not going to class, um, leaving early,... --\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: you know, and you didn't do it. You faced...\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: those, and so you're showing yourself that you can do it.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Is this the same thing?\nJOSH: Yeah. It's the same thing.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So, so perhaps you could use the principles of what you learned from going to class and what not and apply it to this.\nJOSH: Yeah. I, I mean it just, uh, it's one metaphor for the next task or the next anxiety issue.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right.\nJOSH: So I definitely recognize a pattern,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: um, and so the smaller steps that we've broken down into,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: in the past couple of weeks,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. And you know, because it's gonna be three weeks between our visits, um, you know, that's, that's a lot of time. It's easy to procrastinate when you know don't have a... have a session for three weeks,...\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: You and I are good emailers. Do you want to email me some updates to let me know how you're... --\nJOSH: Sure.\nAMY WENZEL: doing?\nJOSH: Yeah. I can email you some updates.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. That would be terrific. What do you think of our plan here?\nJOSH: I think it's a good plan. Um, I definitely have to have some kind of plan for these next few weeks, cause they're gonna be really stressful,... --\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: Um, I have a lot of historical bad things that have happened, but... --\nAMY WENZEL: Right. You're writing, re-writing history right here.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: Yup.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So, um, the likelihood that you're gonna do all this stuff is what?\nJOSH: Pretty good. I mean I have three weeks to do it, so I'm gonna say it's 100% likelihood.\nAMY WENZEL: Mm, hm.\nJOSH: But, uh, I mean I've always done... Did you have anything else to add to the Thought Log or is that the end of the class\nAMY WENZEL: That would be the end. Now we just really want to nail down that process of coming up with compelling, believable alternative responses. And you're well on your way there.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: All right. Because the alternative responses are the name of the game. The automatic thoughts, I think increase your anxiety, and they decrease the likelihood that you're gonna be proactive and that you're going to complete some of these tasks. The alternative responses are going to help you be more balanced, reduce your anxiety, then you're going to be more likely to actually tackle some of these tasks.\nJOSH: Mm, hm.\nAMY WENZEL: So do you buy that?\nJOSH: Yeah I buy that.\nAMY WENZEL: All right. So, was there anything that we did here that you thought was barking up the wrong tree, or that you thought I didn't get right?\nJOSH: No. No. You backed off the, uh, the Job Fair thing, so that was cool.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",
        "output": "The therapist: right. right. well that's why this is a collaborative process. i mean, you know, so, so in theory, would it be nice to do... to go to the job fair? maybe yeah in order to work with the automatic thoughts and overcome avoidance, but you have other avenues, and so we, we... you're right. i love the way that you looked at that. you wanna maximize those strengths and the connections that you do have.\n\nThe psychological template is: \n```markdown\n## Personal Information\n- Name: Josh\n- Age: 24\n- Gender: unknown\n- Occupation: student\n- Marital Status:

It was a long break.\nAMY WENZEL: I know. I know. But I was taking a look at your questionnaires and it looks like your score on the depression inventory is essentially down to zero.\nJOSH: I haven't been feeling much depression at all lately.\nAMY WENZEL: Great, great.\nJOSH: Last couple of weeks.\nAMY WENZEL: Little bit of anxiety but nothing out of the ordinary. Still on the low side. Correct?\nJOSH: Yeah, especially for the time of the year that it is in the a academic calendar.\nAMY WENZEL: Right right.\nJOSH: I've got finals next week.\nAMY WENZEL: Exactly, cause you were saying last time, three weeks ago that it was ramping up a bit. And so we needed to do some prep work in terms of coping. But we've been largely successful?\nJOSH: Yeah. I've been pretty successful. It's been a lot of work. I've taken a couple different exams and a couple different courses the past few weeks.\nAMY WENZEL: Wow, Okay.\nJOSH: Had some success on some of them.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. And you sent me a list of some of those successes.\nJOSH: Yeah, the success log.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah definitely. What else do you wanna make sure we accomplish here today?\nJOSH: Um, I mean I guess it's just the last, our last session so whatever you wanted to talk about. Wrapping things up, I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Sure. Well you know there are some other parts of the homework. So I thought I would check in on some of those other parts as well.\nJOSH: Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Um, you know I wanted to take a look at the goals that we set for treatment in our first visit and really do some measuring and seeing the degree to which we've achieved our goals. Does that sound okay?\nJOSH: Yeah, that sounds okay.\nAMY WENZEL: And then I also thought we could do something, the technical term for this is called relapse prevention. But it's really just looking at, okay, what have you learned, how can you apply this to future stressors? What are some warning signs where it seems like the depression or the anxiety might be reaching a level where you might need to do even something more than practicing the skills, like maybe seeing another therapist, contacting a mental health professional, where you have all this information in one place so you can consult it when you need it.\nJOSH: Okay, yeah. I figured there'd be some sort of closure.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Some sort of closure. We will get closure. Absolutely. Absolutely. Should we start with the homework?\nJOSH: Um, sure. I didn't, I did the success log. I didn't keep too many, I didn't keep track of anything else.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. Well would you like me to remind you what I wrote down for homework?\nJOSH: Sure.\nAMY WENZEL: So one is a success log, so we're on the same page there. And then you were also going to continue to keep the thought record in Evernote, when you had automatic thoughts that are upsetting or anxiety provoking. But you said in the email that you lost track of the chart. So what happened there?\nJOSH: I had written it a couple times down. I'm full up on memory space for my Evernote. So sometimes if you just write stuff down and then it doesn't say anything, it disappears.\nAMY WENZEL: Really? Okay well that's good to know about Evernote. I did not know that.\nJOSH: Yeah. With the recording of a lecture, I had too. I'm upset about that.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, okay. Okay. So well let me just ask you then in general that systematic strategy for laying out the situation, thoughts and really evaluating them, from a general perspective, do you see value in that?\nJOSH: Yeah, I see value in it. And I have some good examples, like over the past few weeks of, and one of them a success that I didn't put on there is I went to a job fair.\nAMY WENZEL: Did you?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: And I wasn't gonna push you on the job fair. Okay. Good for you.\nJOSH: So I went to that. And I was really anxious about going to that. And I had like a million reasons not to go to it.\nAMY WENZEL: Uh huh. You did it.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Can we talk more about that for a little bit?\nJOSH: Sure. Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so obviously the situation is you're faced with this job fair. The emotion was you're really anxious. What were some of the key automatic thoughts?\nJOSH: Well I'm always scared of judgment. Like we recognized that in some of my other stuff.\nAMY WENZEL: Absolutely.\nJOSH: I don't like going to places where people are supposed to be judging you. It's really hard for me to do.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you basically had the idea that you were gonna be judged, what, negatively?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. What trap might you have fallen into there?\nJOSH: Um, just overlooking the positive and thinking the worst.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. Some mental filtering down in the negative. I'm disqualifying the positive. And probably doing some mind reading, right?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: You would do that in the first place. So how can you start to get some distance from that?\nJOSH: Uh, I mean it was just, I don't know. I needed to go just for the practice. I figured I guess I evaluated it in such a way that don't go looking for a job, go looking like for the practice of getting a job.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so that took pressure off of you.\nJOSH: Yeah. I wasn't trying to be successful at the job fair. And I probably really wasn't. But I went around and I talked to different employers. There wasn't a lot of people there for my major it turned out anyway. But I made the rounds so.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So ultimately did you view it as a positive experience or a negative experience?\nJOSH: It was a positive experience, yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. When you were, when you looked at it in that alternative way, the alternative response, saying this doesn't have to be for getting a job, this could just be for practice, how much did it bring down your anxiety?\nJOSH: Um, probably like about half. I was still anxious about going and seeing somebody but I don't know. I guess different companies, you know, that you're more nervous about than other companies. So I saw the social security administration guy first.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh yeah.\nJOSH: Like he's for the government. So it's like I want him to think very highly of that company I guess, it's easier to be more worried about a fortune company or prestigious insurance company or something like that.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So when you looked at it as just practice, it brought your anxiety down to about half. Do you think that it actually enabled you to go?\nJOSH: Yeah, probably.\nAMY WENZEL: So if your anxiety was double that before, do you think you might've put it off or not gone?\nJOSH: I might've just not gone at all. I don't know. I've, I skipped career fairs in the past. I didn't wanna go.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: I was anxious about it.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Yeah, this is definitely a success. What did you learn from this experience that you might be able to take with you and apply in the future?\nJOSH: Um, I mean, like when I went there I was just practicing talking to people and just holding a conversation with strangers and talking yourself up and the elevator speech and everything. So I just learned that I could do it. So it's just positive reinforcement for next time.\nAMY WENZEL: Terrific.\nJOSH: I need to do it and I wanna get that job.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. Does it increase the likelihood then that you'll attend another job fair when the opportunity comes up?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Good.\nJOSH: It's just not so much a job fair, just like a one on one interaction.\nAMY WENZEL: Right.\nJOSH: With a stranger that's judging you.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, did you actually have any evidence that they were judging you negatively?\nJOSH: No, there wasn't any evidence of that.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Yeah definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So I guess, since this is our last session and since your Evernote is still full, how do we wanna leave this thought modification process with you? Are you at the point where you can do it in your head systematically?\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah And I've started asking my girlfriend, \"What's the worst that's gonna happen to you?\" And she started asking me as a response.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So one way is to go through it systematically in your head. Another way is to work it out kind of back and forth with your girlfriend.\nJOSH: Yeah, and we're moving in together. And we both have anxiety. So.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. It does help to talk it out with another person. Okay. My only question would be, this is gonna pay you back on something, an observation I made last week was that, or last time was that sometimes when people do it in their head they start to take shortcuts. Remember I called it the yeah yeah yeah syndrome where people start saying, \"What's the evidence? Oh yeah yeah yeah. I know there's no evidence.\" And they dismiss it. Did you find yourself doing those shortcuts or were you able to go systematically?\nJOSH: Um, I mean probably both. I mean I didn't write it down so maybe I was taking the shortcut. I didn't write it down.\nAMY WENZEL: On the other hand there's evidence it was helpful. Right?\nJOSH: Yeah. And I know that I know how to write it down if I have to.\nAMY WENZEL: You know how to write it down. Exactly. So are there things in your Evernote that you can clear out just so you have space if you need it?\nJOSH: Yeah. But probably not until after finals.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, don't worry about it until after finals. So you'll eventually have the Evernote as a backup if you need to write it down. Um and then otherwise, doing it in your head and just maybe being aware or being mindful of the shortcuts. So if you notice yourself doing that to remind yourself to be more systematic.\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So thought modification overall your, I guess your view of how effective it is, is what?\nJOSH: Um, it's a useful tool.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. Okay, that you'll continue using in the future I guess. Alright, good. Good. So here's what else I wrote down for homework. You were pretty clear that even though the job search was terrifying, that you really needed to get, start getting on it now rather than waiting until after finals. So you were gonna maybe do a comprehensive list of tasks for the job search and then you said you wanted to be held accountable for submitting at least a resume, right?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: But or finishing your resume and applying for one job. But if I'm looking correctly at your success log, it looks like you exceeded that.\nJOSH: Yeah, I applied for three jobs.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh good for you.\nJOSH: I am all over the internet.\nAMY WENZEL: All over the internet.\nJOSH: I'm on Monster dot com and everything.\nAMY WENZEL: Are you? Are you?\nJOSH: If somebody's watching this tape and wants to give me a job, I'm probably still looking for one.\nAMY WENZEL: Ha ha. You were a bit ambivalent when I talked to you last time. On the one hand you were very motivated, you wanted the independence, you wanted to start getting a job. But I think your quote was, \"Boy, I'd be President if I actually followed through on all of these plans that I had.\" How did you overcome that hump and actually follow through?\nJOSH: My girlfriend pushed me a lot. I won't lie. But I guess it just, you gotta feel good about yourself.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So you feel good about yourself.\nJOSH: There's some other minor successes in the week that led up to that.\nAMY WENZEL: Really? So those minor successes accumulated that then kind of helped you to have more confidence in your resume? Okay.\nJOSH: Basically what it came down to.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah.\nJOSH: I just did it a little bit at a time.\nAMY WENZEL: Good. You did a little bit at a time. And if you're actually paying attention to the minor successes, it seems like you're no longer not giving yourself credit, you're no longer disqualifying the positives. You're really keeping those in your mind.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, okay good. Good.\nJOSH: And my vacancy rate at the property management where I work at is like a zero so I got a lot of free time right now.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, okay. Okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Great. So that's a success in terms of doing your job well.\nJOSH: Yeah, at work.\nAMY WENZEL: The bonus is that you have free time now to apply for jobs.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Um, another thing I guess I used the thought modification process for is like I had this lady up and quit on me.\nAMY WENZEL: At the property management job?\nJOSH: Yeah, on the company, not me, she's not my employee. But I'm the one that had to train her replacement and work her hours until somebody else comes in.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh boy, so that's a stressor that you don't need during this time of finals.\nJOSH: Yeah. So that was like a week and a half ago, a week ago.\nAMY WENZEL: So how did thought modification help there?\nJOSH: Um, thought modification helped because I didn't get upset about it. And within an hour after the lady quitting, because I wasn't even at work that day, I was at GSU studying, I had a For Wanted ad, Help Wanted ad on Craig's List.\nAMY WENZEL: Really? Okay. And what did you say to yourself so as not to get upset?\nJOSH: Um, it was just like I don't have time to get upset. I just needed to get a solution, I was just more focused on he solution.\nAMY WENZEL: So kind of like that evaluation question, \"What can I do about it?\" It sounds like getting anxious and ruminating on the implications of this was not gonna be helpful.\nJOSH: No. So I just did the first thing I could do.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Great, great. And it, and that for about a week and a half but now you have a replacement.\nJOSH: Yeah. Vacancy rate's still at zero.\nAMY WENZEL: And the vacancy rate's still at zero.\nJOSH: It's been a busy couple weeks but.\nAMY WENZEL: Busy couple weeks but successful couple of weeks.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So how do you keep the momentum going with the job search?\nJOSH: Um, I just keep, I'm applying, I just decided to apply to every job in my two related fields within a certain radius in Chicago.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: That I can get to from where I'll be moving to.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. And how many jobs approximately is that?\nJOSH: There might be 100 of them but some of them you apply with one click on the Monster, some of them you go through the entire company's website. So like two of the jobs I went to the company's website and one of them was at Monster and then so I mean there might be a couple hundred, who knows. But you just keep applying to them until you get one, I guess. So that's what I'm gonna do.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: And once I move in, if I don't have a job by like May 20th, I'll probably just go to the accounting temp agency.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh sure, sure. Okay. Okay. So that's something. So that'll give you some experience, you'll be making some money.\nJOSH: That's given me, lowered my anxiety about it too.\nAMY WENZEL: Because you have an alternative.\nJOSH: Yeah, the temp agency.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah, no absolutely, absolutely. Okay. And so if you've applied to three jobs by now, at what rate should you be applying for jobs?\nJOSH: I think I could do three jobs a day.\nAMY WENZEL: Really?\nJOSH: I've just been busy lately.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. What's involved in applying for jobs online in your field?\nJOSH: Um, searching the jobs in all the different job search engines, applying for the jobs, maintaining your Linked In profile, which I don't do, I need to do.\nAMY WENZEL: Is that one thing that you're putting off?\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So how can you use the resume experience and apply it to the Linked In?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Okay.\nJOSH: I don't have many pictures of myself where I look good enough to use for Linked In.\nAMY WENZEL: Do you own a suit?\nJOSH: Yes.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So could you feasibly put on the suit and just have your girlfriend snap a picture?\nJOSH: Yeah, I could.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. What would run through your mind?\nJOSH: I'd be okay with that.\nAMY WENZEL: You'd be okay with that.\nJOSH: I've just been putting the whole thing off.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: We've been so busy lately.\nAMY WENZEL: You've been busy. Yeah. So you were busy though, when you were putting together the resume.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So getting over that hump and actually doing it is what?\nJOSH: Try and find something else you avoid doing more.\nAMY WENZEL: Ha ha. Okay.\nJOSH: And then doing that instead of it, I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. When's the next time you're gonna see your girlfriend?\nJOSH: Um, probably Saturday night.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Maybe even not. Maybe I'll just take a, I'm really anxious about finals so I'm trying not to be anxious about getting everything done. So I guess I have to take the weekend off. So we'll see. That effects the relationship a lot when you take a whole week off.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So seeing her on the weekend, let me make sure I understand what you're saying, that could be good not only for the relationship, I guess it also could be good cause you'd be seeing her and she can snap a picture of you in your suit, but then it would also give you a little bit of a break from studying for finals.\nJOSH: Yeah. Every time I hang out with my girlfriend I just think that I need to be getting some kind of schoolwork done. You know, that feeling of something you're supposed to be doing. But once I graduate that's probably gonna go away.\nAMY WENZEL: Exactly, that's exactly what I was thinking of. I was thinking you're in the home stretch, right?\nJOSH: May eighth is my last final.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. And it actually sounds healthy to me that you're of course paying close attention to your finals, you're studying, but also giving yourself a little bit of a reward in the form of a break and doing something that enhances the relationship. Okay, okay. So do we actually have a plan for the Linked In picture or is it...\nJOSH: It's just something I have to get done. It's not like a problem thing.\nAMY WENZEL: It's not like a problem thing.\nJOSH: I mean it probably is.\nAMY WENZEL: If we're honest.\nJOSH: Depends on who you ask.\nAMY WENZEL: Uh huh.\nJOSH: I should've had it done but it's not a big deal.\nAMY WENZEL: And the only thing that needs to be done is the picture and that's it?\nJOSH: I need to like set up the profile and everything.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, you need to set up the profile.\nJOSH: I registered, I just didn't, it's like having a blank Facebook.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, okay. Okay. And do you know how important Linked In is in your field?\nJOSH: I've heard that employers check it to see what skin color you have.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: So I don't know how important that will be.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. And I've really heard that it kind of runs the gamut, for myself as a psychologist, and someone who's also in academics and whatnot, I have a lot of connections but it's just mostly for keeping in touch with professionals. But on the other hand, I know some people who are attorneys and who've actually drummed up business on Linked In and so it's actually pretty essential for their business.\nJOSH: Yeah. Probably semi-important for me. We'll see.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: Maybe I'll do better once I have my Linked In set up.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. So I'm kind of, I kind of have the sense that we're not 100 percent firm on this, that we're identifying it's a problem, kind of like we identified last week with the resume or last time with the resume. But we had a more specific plan in terms of getting that done. So how do we take that same spirit? That more specificity and apply it to Linked In? Especially given this time of year when finals are coming up.\nJOSH: I could just try to get it done this weekend, I guess. It's just a simple thing to do I guess.\nAMY WENZEL: Well you've also told me in the past that your girlfriend does encourage you pretty strongly to get these things done. And you actually didn't view that as a problem, you actually viewed it for the most part as helpful, right?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So what if you were to just express to her that this is kind of the next step in the job search process and that maybe the two of you together could work on it this weekend?\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely right. But if I told her that, she would be like, \"You're an idiot, cause I've been telling you this the entire time.\" That's kind of where it comes from. Like she is the one saying, \"You need to get it done.\"\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. What's an alternative? You know your situation better than I do.\nJOSH: I mean I could just use a picture, like an old picture of me in a suit.\nAMY WENZEL: Uh huh.\nJOSH: I could just do that.\nAMY WENZEL: And do it even before the weekend?\nJOSH: Yeah. And then just wait till I get a new picture to update it.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh I see. So you seize the moment, you do it sooner rather than later with the idea that you're just gonna replace the picture. You know like maybe over the weekend.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. Well if you see her then over the weekend then that would be Saturday. Today's Wednesday. What's your schedule looking like over the next couple of days in terms of when you might work this in?\nJOSH: Work. I just work. I can even wear a suit to work and have somebody take a picture then.\nAMY WENZEL: That's a good solution as well.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Um, and since you're at 100 percent capacity, you're a zero percent openings, you're gonna have time tomorrow or Friday?\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean I'm training two people but I'll have time. I'm replacing myself too.\nAMY WENZEL: You're replacing yourself.\nJOSH: So there's two people that need to be trained now.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Instead of the one.\nAMY WENZEL: So might there be, when might there be free time then?\nJOSH: I could just make one of the new people take a picture of me.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh. So should we make this official that at some point when you're working at the property management company, tomorrow or Friday, you're gonna get some picture up on Linked In and get your basic profile up.\nJOSH: Yeah. That's a good idea. Maybe I'll have somebody take a picture of me while I'm showing apartments.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, there you go. And a professional in action.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. That's terrific. What's the likelihood that this is gonna happen?\nJOSH: Um, it's like 85 percent that I'll get it done.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. The other 15 percent?\nJOSH: The other 15 percent is if like an emergency happened.\nAMY WENZEL: And that's just out of your control.\nJOSH: Yeah, it's out of my control.\nAMY WENZEL: So the backup plan for that 15 percent would be what then?\nJOSH: I get it done by Saturday with my girlfriend.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Just a regular suit picture.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: The good thing is I had my suits pressed and everything so it's not like I have...\nAMY WENZEL: Oh good, so that's ready to go. Okay, okay.\nJOSH: Usually it's crumpled up somewhere.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. So basically then the backup plan is to do it on Saturday and maybe you don't need to give her all the explanation that I was suggesting before to avoid the idiot comment, right.\nJOSH: No, I mean she'd be glad to help me.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.

So.\nJOSH: I have time blocked off to study for them.\nAMY WENZEL: So time is blocked off to study for them. It sounds like, I'm hearing conviction in your voice that you're gonna follow through with this.\nJOSH: Yeah. All my finals, I did well on the previous test, so I know what to do for the next one.\nAMY WENZEL: So in the past you've had these thoughts or this sense of impending doom, like you're gonna show up and either find out bad news that you're not in as good of standing in the class as you thought you were or just the test will be really difficult. Any automatic thoughts like that?\nJOSH: No. But I've been like practicing all semester just by going. Before I was getting anxious before I even got to class so.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right.\nJOSH: So I would be missing class a lot.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. So you've just been going, you've overcome avoidance in that way. So it sounds like there's not a lot of danger that some of the old tendencies are gonna come back with the finals, right?\nJOSH: Um hmm.\n\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. Should we turn our attention to the success log?\nJOSH: Sure.\nAMY WENZEL: My favorite part of the homework each time. So again, we've been keeping the success log now over the course of, on a number of our visits, really in terms of our model here. We were kind of going from this, \"I'm a failure\" orientation to some of the automatic thoughts that would come up in particular situations where there is a potential to failure. And we wanted to kind of go the other direction, right, and really create the \"I'm a success\" type of core belief.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah, having the success core belief is really big in me right now. So I'm trying to change how people perceive me for job interviews so.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. Right, so how you carry yourself is important.\nJOSH: Yeah. Definitely after that mentality.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Give me the percentage now that you believe that you're a success.\nJOSH: Um, probably like a 60, 75 percent.\nAMY WENZEL: 60, 75 percent.\nJOSH: It was a lot lower before.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. Absolutely.\nJOSH: I just gotta clench this job and then I'm there.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. So you think once you get the job you'll be more around close to 100?\nJOSH: Yeah, close to 100.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Success.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So I was gonna ask you what that remaining 25 to 35 percent was and it really sounds like a job.\nJOSH: It's just getting a job.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So can we go through the success log?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So you wrote \"intermediate ACCT.\"\nJOSH: Intermediate accounting. I got an A on the test.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh you got an A on the test. Okay. You went and you looked at the condo with your girlfriend's parents. And there was no anxiety over spending time with her father. That is a success.\nJOSH: No. We talked about like going to school and stuff, which I don't like talking to him about. And what I'm looking for in a job. But we talked for like 20 minutes about it and I was fine.\nAMY WENZEL: So it sounds like you didn't even need to use thought modification because there was no anxiety.\nJOSH: No. I mean I was anxious just like thinking about it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Afterwards, I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: You were anxious thinking about it afterwards?\nJOSH: Like, before the actual, like we sat down at the bar across the street from the condo.\nAMY WENZEL: Uh huh.\nJOSH: So I was anxious about sitting down with him. But, once we were there it was fine.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. When you were anxious about sitting down with him, did you catch any automatic thoughts?\nJOSH: Um, it's like what if he asked me really hard questions. But he's never done that before so.\nAMY WENZEL: So that's important evidence, he's never done that before. Okay. Um, another A on your second auditing exam. And the auditing was the tough class or where you thought that, you were surprised that there was one exam where you didn't do as well as you wanted.\nJOSH: Yeah, I had done bad on the first exam for auditing.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. And this is interesting, I think this is something you're giving, you're really proud of, number three student in your B-Law, is that business law?\nJOSH: Yeah, business law two.\nAMY WENZEL: After your third exam. You wrote that twice on here.\nJOSH: I did?\nAMY WENZEL: You did. But that's great because...\nJOSH: I might have been copying and pasting some stuff.\nAMY WENZEL: You know what? I actually, I like that you wrote it twice because I think your previous tendency was to dismiss some of the positives. So I would love you to savor these moments. This is clearly a success.\nJOSH: Yeah. Yeah and then there was the number third student, got an 87 percent in the class total grade and there are some extra credits. So I'm probably gonna get the A.\nAMY WENZEL: Great, great. Alrighty. Because you're finding that professors are reasonable.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. Okay. You went to meet the CPA's extra credit.\nJOSH: Yeah that's extra credit that I was just talking about.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh that was it.\nJOSH: It was an event.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. And then continued success in your diet. And you have lost 23.8 pounds since the start, as of today, which was four months. That's amazing.\nJOSH: Thank you.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, terrific. And that's interesting because one of the issues that you had brought up when we first met was like lack of follow through and you have really followed through on this diet.\nJOSH: Yeah. It's been hard.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. So how do you explain that? What made you so successful?\nJOSH: Um, I think I just needed to have success in something that wasn't academic.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm.\nJOSH: And I think it's easier to get hired when...\nAMY WENZEL: So non-academic success comes more easily and this was actually motivating in terms of presenting yourself well for getting a job.\nJOSH: Yeah. It just helps me doing other things.\nAMY WENZEL: And do you feel better physically? Do you have more energy?\nJOSH: Yeah, I feel better physically.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. Still running?\nJOSH: Nope. I haven't run in a little while. I've been busy. But I've just been sticking with the diet.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I'd like to run again.\nAMY WENZEL: So either way, even though you haven't been running, all the more impressive that you're able to continue to lose weight.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Just been eating meat.\nAMY WENZEL: And then \"reached out to estranged father.\"\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Tell me what makes that such a success?\nJOSH: I haven't talked to him in a long time.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I see him, he comes to the office where I work at. But I don't really talk to him so.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And the two of you are really estranged? I mean,\nJOSH: I don't talk to him at all.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: He moved and I didn't know where he moved to.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh goodness.\nJOSH: I've never been over to his place or anything. Not friends on Facebook.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So how did you make that happen?\nJOSH: Um, I needed something from him. And then we met to look at furniture that he had in some garage somewhere. Cause he had the only key. So I had to. Cause I wanted to see the stuff. But we ended up talking for a long time.\nAMY WENZEL: Really? And so was it hard for you to do that?\nJOSH: I didn't want to do it.\nAMY WENZEL: So you did some of the tough stuff. And did you anticipate that it would turn out badly, or that it would be a bad experience?\nJOSH: I just figured he wouldn't, he would say no.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. But he actually said...\nJOSH: Yeah, yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So what does that tell you for the future?\nJOSH: Um, well I tried to borrow his truck to move and he said no so, I don't know, I guess that was a big ask to begin with.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. So I guess the evidence is mixed. I mean you might have some continued challenges with him but he's not automatically going to shoot down all of your requests.\nJOSH: No.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

So you took a big step.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Definitely a success. Oh and here's \"attended and participated in the GSU job fair.\" \"Applied to three jobs.\" \"Moved the refrigerator for your condo.\"\nJOSH: Yeah. Oh my God.\nAMY WENZEL: So that was an ordeal?\nJOSH: Yeah. I mean I just fit a refrigerator in a jeep.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: It was really hard.\nAMY WENZEL: Like a full sized kitchen refrigerator.\nJOSH: Yeah, I had to take all the doors off.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: And it was nerve racking driving it around with the gate open.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh yeah.\nJOSH: I guess it wasn't that big of a success but...\nAMY WENZEL: Don't disqualify a positive. To me that's something that the old Josh would've avoided or you would have maybe catastrophized a little bit more, like if all the gates were open, like \"This is gonna come tumbling out or cause an accident.\" Right?\nJOSH: Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: And I'm not sensing any of that.\nJOSH: No.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So you know one of the things that I had suggested in our previous visit was to combine all of these success logs to see the totality of them or how they've accumulated. Were you able to do that? Or are they all still in separate files?\nJOSH: They're in the same file. But they're not put together as one list.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, but they're not together as one list?\nJOSH: No. They're all in the same Evernote but I haven't...\nAMY WENZEL: Because Evernote has files, right? So maybe they're all on the same file, the file folder but not the same document.\nJOSH: I might have lost some of them. Thank God I emailed them to you because I can go back and get em from there.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. Okay. And do you think this idea of combining them into one list, is it unnecessary for you?\nJOSH: Um, no, I don't think it's unnecessary.\nAMY WENZEL: Do you remember what my rationale was for it?\nJOSH: Yeah, I just like to see the list and feel more confident about it.\nAMY WENZEL: Right. It goes back to that person I told her who had 130 items on his success log. And he literally would look at the success log and he could not argue with 130 successes. I think I pointed out in our last visit that you've had five or six of these over the course of time when we've done this. And we've been doing this since our second or third visit. So and this is more than five or six. So you have to have probably like 25, 30.\nJOSH: Yeah, probably.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah.\nJOSH: I mean, I've looked back on them too.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: They don't need to be together.\nAMY WENZEL: They don't need to be together. So for you they aren't necessary. Okay.\nJOSH: I'll probably put them together since you suggested it.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Yeah, I just don't want you to lose them because you know we have chipped away a lot of that belief that you're a failure and I get the sense that for the most part you believe that you're successful or you've had successes and the job's gonna be the icing on the cake. Probably realistically, we all face stressors or difficulties in our lives where some of those old core beliefs can be reactivated. So I would like you to have easy access to either one success log or this pool of them so you can go back to all of them and just see how they've accumulated and get your dose of the 130.\nJOSH: Yeah, okay.\nAMY WENZEL: Make sense?\nJOSH: I mean I'll probably keep up with the success log.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, yeah. Good. Good.\nJOSH: So hopefully I just, if I don't have to give it to you, I'll just probably keep it as one list.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Would it be helpful to be held accountable a little, maybe by showing it to your girlfriend or showing it to somebody else if you and I aren't meeting anymore?\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: That's not something I would do.\nAMY WENZEL: That's not something you would do. Well the one thing about you, our goal was to overcome avoidance and overcome some of the procrastination. And that has happened. Right?\nJOSH: Yeah, definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Speaking of, I wanted to go over our progress towards our treatment goals and this is a perfect lead in because our number one goal was to overcome avoidance. And you said the way that we would know that you overcame avoidance was to graduate, attend your classes, stay in classes, completing a financial aid form and doing a resume actually.\nJOSH: Yeah. That's funny.\nAMY WENZEL: Did you achieve all that stuff?\nJOSH: Yeah, I achieved all that.\nAMY WENZEL: So what...\nJOSH: I left my tax class early yesterday.\nAMY WENZEL: Left your tax class early.\nJOSH: But the attendance was there.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: I have 100 percent attendance.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. 100 percent attendance. That's terrific.\nJOSH: I can't miss now because everybody, there's like eight of us with 100 percent attendance out of 40 and all looking at each other every time he calls our name. You could see it on the board, it's weird.\nAMY WENZEL: Ah ha, ah ha. Okay. So what percentage of the way there are you in terms of overcoming avoidance in general?\nJOSH: I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: I feel like you could always be avoiding something.\nJOSH: Um hmm.\nAMY WENZEL: So maybe not 100 percent but...\nJOSH: If you've never, I don't know. Maybe like 80 percent.\nAMY WENZEL: You know, I was thinking in the 80, maybe even 90 range. So you might have these little instances where for example you left a tax class early. But for the most part, I'm seeing you sticking with your commitments, you did the homework, especially when you told me at the beginning that writing wasn't really your style for homework and you found a way to make that work. So I think we have a lot of evidence from our work in here that you've learned to overcome some of these avoidance tendencies.\nJOSH: Yeah. Definitely.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. And then the problem area in number two, sort of secondary area was mild depression. And that was especially manifest like in the lack of energy. And you thought that we would know that you're making progress on that is if you would pick up your prescription for your Sertralin which you did.\nJOSH: Yeah, I did.\nAMY WENZEL: And if you'd be playing guitar more. Which you did once.\nJOSH: I have been. Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. And so you have been in general?\nJOSH: Um hmm.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. And your depression...\nJOSH: I actually bought a new amp I think since then.\nAMY WENZEL: Really? Great.\nJOSH: When was that?\nAMY WENZEL: It was I think a couple of visits ago. I don't think it was last visit that we talked about guitar.\nJOSH: Yeah, I think I bought an amp since we said that.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Playing on your own or with a band?\nJOSH: On my own.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: But I mean playing in a band is something I'm kind of looking forward to about moving.\nAMY WENZEL: Um hmm. You wanna join a different band like in where you live?\nJOSH: Yeah. I wanna be part of some kind of band.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah. Do you have one in mind?\nJOSH: No. But Chicago bands, there's like 30 cover bands in like one block.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. Okay. So the location of your new condo is pretty close to some venues?\nJOSH: Yeah. It's very close to that kind of culture where you'd be able to be in a band.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh my gosh. Good for you. Good for you. Alright, so that's something really different. That would be a nice reward to spend the hard work that you're doing with finishing school and working, getting a job, that kind of thing.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So what percentage of the way there are we then in terms of overcoming depression?\nJOSH: I feel pretty good about overcoming depression, a lot more so than anxiety. So I mean maybe 100 percent.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, I think 100 percent. And in terms of overcoming anxiety, is anxiety synonymous with the avoidance or should we make an estimate of how much you've overcome the avoidance?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

So still 80 percent of the way there. 20 percent still, you're a bit vulnerable to it. But for the most part you at least are, even if you're feeling anxious, you're not letting the avoidance take over?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay.\nJOSH: That is true.\nAMY WENZEL: You know a couple of the other areas I was just gonna check in on, even if they weren't officially in our treatment plan, one had actually in my mind had been anxiety around your girlfriend's father. And so that was a nice example that you had just given me.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Anything with church, discomfort with church, or any decisions about what you're gonna...\nJOSH: I went to church on Easter.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh good. Okay.\nJOSH: I went to the breakfast beforehand. So I guess I've been okay going back, I've been back a couple times. But.\nAMY WENZEL: Still concerned that you're being judged negatively, especially by the people...\nJOSH: Maybe. I just don't care anymore cause I'm moving, I'm gonna go to a different church.\nAMY WENZEL: So you're gonna find a new church in the neighborhood you're moving to?\nJOSH: Yeah. My girlfriend and I are gonna go to a different church.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Probably shop around a couple of them.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. And any lingering issues surrounding going to church, belonging to a church, spirituality, that?\nJOSH: No, I think I just have issues with some of the people there. I thought those particular people were super judgmental.\nAMY WENZEL: So it was really situation specific to that church?\nJOSH: Yeah. It was situation specific.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, okay. So you're actually looking forward to joining another congregation.\nJOSH: There can be another band I could join, it could be a worship band. But I prefer to play at a bar, I think this time.\nAMY WENZEL: Right, right. Okay. Drink your craft beer.\nJOSH: Yeah, drink my craft beer. Gain weight again.\nAMY WENZEL: Ha ha. Well you're balancing it pretty well. You're allowed to have a beer here and there.\nJOSH: Yeah.\n\nAMY WENZEL: You know let me give you this then. Um, this is that prevention plan that I was talking about. And I wonder if we can just go through a couple of things on this just so we could really consolidate the work that we've done together. Does that sound okay?\nJOSH: Sure. You want me to write on this?\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah, sure. If you think it would be helpful. I know that the papers, it's not the best way of learning for you, maybe we can figure out what to transfer to, Evernote, you known when you finally free up some space there. So I have a couple of spaces there just to write down some triggers that you might expect to encounter in the near future, medium future, that we can think about how to cope with.\nJOSH: Um, okay. Not being employed.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so go ahead and write that down, not being employed.\nJOSH: And then I'll put a slash on that for money problems.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So then look at that other column there that kind of corresponding column across the page. What strategy can help you for dealing with that trigger?\nJOSH: Applying for jobs.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, so actually not avoiding, so acting. Okay.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nAMY WENZEL: Anything else that you can do? That is sort of reminiscent of our work in here?\nJOSH: I mean that's my main future concerns, so who knows what else it'll be.\nAMY WENZEL: Well do you think that underneath acting you could actually just write down thought modification? So you could actually identify whether there are any catastrophic thoughts. And that's the thing. I'm kinda thinking back to when you were anxious about the tire and kind of anxious about some other money problems. And I thought you were so balanced in the conclusions that you drew where you like, \"Okay, well I could borrow,\" or you could do some things that you didn't want to do but they were backups if you had to that reduced the anxiety. Kind of like your attitude now towards the job, that if you don't get a job, you could do the accounting temp agency. And it's not as ideal but you have it there. So that's real good thought modification. Anything else that you can see being a trigger in the near or medium future?\nJOSH: Um, I mean not really. Maybe the relationship's gonna get stressful cause we're moving in together. But it's kind of expected.\nAMY WENZEL: So what? Should you write down, maybe getting on each other's nerves a little bit?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Or adjusting to the transition of living together?\nJOSH: Another thing is gonna be working full time again, after working part time.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, so write that down too. Okay.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nJOSH: I can avoid the anxiety of working full time if I like my job. But I am desperate for a job so.\nAMY WENZEL: So you might end up taking a job you don't like.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: So what'll be a strategy that's help you deal with...\nJOSH: I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: Yeah.\nJOSH: Xanax. I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. I mean I just wonder whether thought modification would be helpful there as well because you could really acknowledge maybe that it's temporary. You can acknowledge that you're at least making some money, that you're at least getting some experience. You can acknowledge the other parts of your life that are going well like the fact that you've moved in with your girlfriend, finding a new church, finding a band. So you're not tunnel visioned in on how miserable you feel at work if you end up getting a job that you don't like.\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. What about strategies for dealing with adjustments or growing pains living with your girlfriend?\nJOSH: Um, I don't know. Just not being in the apartment I guess if we get on each other's nerves. I don't know.\nAMY WENZEL: You think that's avoidance?\nJOSH: Yeah, it's probably avoidance.\nAMY WENZEL: You know are the two of you good communicators?\nJOSH: Yeah, we're good communicators. We even talked about having alone time.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh, okay. Okay. So maybe the strategy is sort of like proactive communication. Kind of like nipping it in the bud, anticipating some of these things and then doing some problem solving ahead of time.\nJOSH: I'm gonna drop that word on her later, proactive communication.\nAMY WENZEL: Proactive communication. I like it.\nJOSH: It's another thing I was reading in a relationship book.\nAMY WENZEL: I also have a space there to write any other strategies that the two of us worked on together that you found helpful. Just so we have again listed in one place here.\nJOSH: I mean like I just call it what's the worst that can happen, but you call that thought modification.\nAMY WENZEL: Write down what's the worst that can happen. I think that's fine to put it in your own words.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nAMY WENZEL: Should you also make a note to yourself to review the success log, since that was so central to our work together?\nJOSH: Yeah.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. You see the next category or the next set of questions. I have is just warning signs that things might be going in the opposite direction so you can catch it before they overtake you.\nJOSH: Missing work.\nAMY WENZEL: Oh yes. Yeah I would agree with that.\nJOSH: And stagnating.\nAMY WENZEL: Stagnating. And stagnating would be defined as what?\nJOSH: Sitting on the couch looking at Reddit and not looking for a job.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay, write that down. Sitting on the couch. Maybe also like not being as active, like not sitting with your diet.\nJOSH: I'm going off my diet once I move. I can't afford to eat meat on my own.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. So maybe the diet wouldn't be an indicator but, so the stagnation, the inertia, definitely missing work.\nJOSH: Physical healthiness.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Would be a symbol.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay.\nJOSH: Of how anxious I am.\nAMY WENZEL: Okay. And that last question there, what will you do if end up seeing warning signs?\nJOSH: Call Dr. Amy Wenzel's personal cell phone. I don't know.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",
