Did you have any questions about that or anything I asked.\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No.\nUNKNOWN: Dr. Kemble was very descriptive. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh good, okay. Good. Well, just to give you an idea of what to expect today. This will take about an hour and during that time I will ask questions just to understand how it might be helpful. And then at the end I'll save time to talk with you about my recommendations and explain what I do in counseling with people and talk with you about whether you think that would be helpful to you or not.\nUNKNOWN: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. All right. And I'm going to take a few notes as you answer questions, okay, great. That's okay. So just to kind of start with the medical information you had on your form, you don't have any major medical problems.\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No recent head injuries or major surgeries or anything like that?\nUNKNOWN: A major surgery I had a cesarean section in 2007, that's my only surgery.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay, okay. Okay. And you are not on any medications either?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No, so you are pretty healthy.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, good. That's nice. So, where did you grow up?\nUNKNOWN: I grew up in Marissa, Illinois, so I'm local.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. And with both parents, two parents or?\nUNKNOWN: My -- both of my parents, but also a stepfather.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And so, how old were you -- did your parents they split up and then.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, I was about probably three or four, and then my mom -- she -- my mom got married when I was nine.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So your mom remarried when you were about nine and that's your stepdad and you were...\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: ...raised by him, partially two of them, yeah. And do you have -- did you keep a relationship with your bio-dad?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then how -- oh, and then do you have siblings?\nUNKNOWN: Yes, I have a brother who is a year older and I have a stepsister who is four years younger.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So one elder brother, one younger sister, so you are the middle child.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay. How would you describe your childhood?\nUNKNOWN: Energetic. Yeah, I had a lot of energy, very close to my family, my grandparents live next door to me. So, we've grown very closely with my family, my cousins, and aunts and uncles.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, wow, that's nice. Yeah. So you felt pretty secured growing up there?\nUNKNOWN: Definitely.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Any abuse you're growing up at all?\nUNKNOWN: Sexual abuse when I was nine, actually on the night my mom got married by my biological father.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And did you tell anybody?\nUNKNOWN: Not until about two years ago.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh.\nUNKNOWN: But I found until my mom as she had already known my dad actually told her his self.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you -- did you go to counseling for that or do you feel like that's still an issue for you at all?\nUNKNOWN: No, I didn't go to counseling. I grow up in fear of it, like, I was afraid to tell anyone because I didn't want anyone to harm him or him to harm himself, because it was an attempt nothing actual, well, it happened, but there was like no insertion or anything, so it was an attempt. But no, no, no counseling or anything, and it works off really well, I have a good relationship with him now, I was able to kind of work through it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Has he apologized or?\nUNKNOWN: I can remember him apologize in the next day, but I really don't think I was old enough to comprehend what was going on. I just remember I was about to run outside, so I ran by bike and he stopped me, and he said, sorry, and I was just like okay and I ran outside to play, but we've never had a conversation about it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. But you feel like that doesn't affect you now in terms of just your life and what you do in your relationships and...\nUNKNOWN: At times, I'm just very cautious. I have a five-year-old daughter and a six-year-old son, so I don't trust him as far as I leaving them alone with him, I would never do that. I don't think that it would happen, but I just out my own caution.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: I'd be just very protective of my own, so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So do you -- you went to high school here and then...\nUNKNOWN: Yes, I went to Ashford Park.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. And then you went on to a college too?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, I took a -- I took a year at college, and then after that year I came home and started working.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Hmmm. What did you do during the year, you said you took?\nUNKNOWN: I was in early childhood education.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay, you worked then, so to save the money and...\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You went to college, yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Actually -- they actually kicked me out of the college. I was a freshman on probation, I failed the class, so they asked me to go and take summer classes, so I did that, I did it at Prairie State and I didn't -- after those summer courses, I didn't return back until 2010.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. To the same school?\nUNKNOWN: No, I started going to Ashford University.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, yeah. I'm not from here, so I'm not as familiar with these places. Yeah, okay. So, and you've been telling me earlier that Ashford University, you're really happy with it, yeah, and then you're about to graduate in May...\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, like next month.\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. That's exciting.\nUNKNOWN: Very.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Are you kind of going to the ceremony?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, probably going to the ceremony and at the end of May I'll start my Master's programs.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh wow.\nUNKNOWN: Keep going.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Wow, okay. And is that an infant child?\nUNKNOWN: No, that would be a higher education, so I could teach high school and college courses.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, okay. Is that with Ashford also?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, that's going to an MA in, what do they call it? Higher Ed?\nUNKNOWN: Higher Education.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. Yeah, Higher Ed. Yeah. And do you want to teach too?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's your essential goal.\nUNKNOWN: I actually want to teach online courses.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, that's nice. Because you've had really good experience with it?\nUNKNOWN: Yes. And I'll be able to -- just teaching online, I'll be able to set it around my schedule, so I will still be able to work here at the Head Start here, I can do both.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you like your work at Head Start?\nUNKNOWN: Yes. I've been doing it for nine years.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I didn't realize until you just said that, that it was Head Start, and you put on the phone that it was a program with small kids.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But Head Start is a wonderful program.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, six weeks to five years old.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Wow. Since nine years -- for the last nine years, oh wow. So, what brings you here today?\nUNKNOWN: I actually saw the flyer that Dr. Kemble sent out and a few other co-workers and I were talking about it and I thought about it and I went to writing her phone number down and like maybe two weeks later I called her to just ask about what it was all about and we talked for some time and I just thought that maybe -- it maybe some things that I haven't dealt with and just to see if I can be helped with some issues that I think are minor but may really be major. So, just a try.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So, what kinds of things?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated Psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Were your families against the marriage?\nUNKNOWN: They just wanted us to wait a little longer. We were rushed due to his mother being married a month before us and she rarely put him out at house and I grow up a Christian background and we were not allowed to live unveiled. So we pushed our marriage up like -- by like six months. So, we only live together unveiled for like 20 days, so everything was rushed.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nUNKNOWN: We were never able to like lay a foundation, and we didn't really get a chance of really know each other's families and get a lot of background information, really get to know each other we were fresh out of college. So...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Where did -- did you meet him in the college?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So, you moved into an apartment together then or with your parents or?\nUNKNOWN: We moved -- the first three years of our marriage we lived with my parents, and so we were able to save up enough, we have both of our children in my parent's home and three years later we were able to move out which -- that's where a lot of issues began.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh.\nUNKNOWN: Because we moved like 45 minutes away and I had never really been away from my family. So I do have a support base, it -- I wasn't like able to get to them right away. We're really have to like take a drive to get to them if anything were to happen or just needless to see him, so I kind of felt like he aborted me from my family.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And whether you said that was sort of like he made the decision or?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. He received a job with his cousin in another field, he actually works in social services. So he was able to get a job which he went from banking to social services. So, it was an increase in pay and he went out there and found an apartment, it was like okay. We're going.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So it made sense because -- did you have children and kids at that point?\nUNKNOWN: Yes, I did.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: And I had, I was just starting a new job as well.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, so, did you lose that job?\nUNKNOWN: No, I didn't lose.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You could keep it, oh.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nUNKNOWN: I had just -- the weekend that we moved in, the following Monday I had to report to the final job.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you had a commute then?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh my...\nUNKNOWN: A 45-minute commute.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh wow, wow, with two little kids and...\nUNKNOWN: Actually they stay home for a year, I moved my brother in with me, and he kept them while we were at work which was a whole another issue, because me and my brother have never really gotten along well. So like every day I will come home, it would be something, some type of argument between us. So, it was just like, he was convenient for me, I trusted him with the kids, but it was really hard living in the house with two grown men, andum, 'cause they have a big room fight.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So the two of them didn't get along very well?\nUNKNOWN: Yes, they did.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: They did. Oh, okay.\nUNKNOWN: It was just me and my brother didn't get along.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. So, he watched the kids though. So, yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So it made sense to have him there, but just difficult.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And so how long ago was that?\nUNKNOWN: That was in 2008.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nUNKNOWN: He lived only for a year.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Till '09?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. And then he left...\nUNKNOWN: To about Christmas time at '09.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then what did you guys do for childcare?\nUNKNOWN: I put my children in the school. I put them in the home daycare at first. They stayed, they went to two different home daycares, and then I put them in a actual daycare center.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, they couldn't come to Head Start with you?\nUNKNOWN: Not in my location.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's too bad. Yeah. But you've stayed with this job then, nine years you said so.\nUNKNOWN: I was actually with that one job for almost five years and when my son went to kindergarten they were unwilling to be flexible with my time, with my 45-minute commute, trying to get my son from school or even at the school program. It -- during the Chicago winters, it would have been horrible, like I said, the commute was already 45-minute, plus add an extreme weather conditions, and so I left that job, and I stayed home actually a week and I got hired at a home daycare 10 minutes away, and my daughter was able to go there with me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh okay. So...\nUNKNOWN: It worked out.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then in addition you have been at Head Start for nine years?\nUNKNOWN: Total.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, all that, total. Okay, yeah. Was that Head Start you worked at before?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh okay, yeah. Yeah. So, when did you and your husband separate?\nUNKNOWN: July of 2013.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, less than a year ago, almost a year. And, well, could you describe him for me, what's he like?\nUNKNOWN: He is kind of like an alpha male. He was raised by all women, his father was in and out. So he had a stepfather, who was very abusive to him and also his mother. And it took a while for his mother to see his side, so with his own personal family mean our children, he needed to do all that he could to make sure he provide it for us, which in turn he was stay at out -- I think he work like 14 hour days, six days a week, and we didn't really get a chance to see him, when he will come home, he will be tired. He is really like eat and like sit on the couch watching sports until he fell asleep, so...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: As he was exhausted?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Mentally drained, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. And so, did he had cranky then too, like you would have arguments or?\nUNKNOWN: No, our arguments would be over financial reasons. He is a saver and I'm a spender. I have -- I impulse buy, so that would create a lot of disagreements, because I would do it and he would say, well, we can't afford that right now, but I would do it anyway, and he would have the bills out, meaning you would have to put in more hours or go on to sort of savings.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So do you agree with him that that was a problem?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: It was just hard for me to stop. I didn't even realize it was that big of a issue until we started going through our bank statements and just actually seeing how much the small purchases added up like going to the Dollar Store, just stopping at the grocery store, just get these few things, they really told hold on, so that was the bulk of our disagreements, it was financial, because he never wanted us to lag.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Have you been able to get that under control?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, oh okay. What helped with that?\nUNKNOWN: Prayer. I actually had to speak to my Pastor about it, because I realized that it really was a issue, like he didn't believe him when I say that it was impulsive and I had a hard time stopping it and I got prayer and just like we separated accounts, so just like I see how much money I spent alone, it helped me to see, like, okay, this is really an issue.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you really took action with your son to make it have to, yeah, to make a change.\nUNKNOWN: Yes, because I never wanted my children to go with that, even they wants. I wanted them to have all of their wants. So I had to take a seat back and just reflect and just see that it was really detrimental and where we lived, we lived in a very pricy area and it was expensive out there, so it was either a year gone, spend ease purchases and/or have a bill and I'd be paying. So...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So right now you are separated?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is that right? Yeah. And so your accounts are separated also?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay. Oh, and what else can I ask you about that though, what your pastor say to you that helped too?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Yeah. Because he did, but then after a while you began seeing the consequences of that, yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Right. He was saying, he wouldn't and then he still would, but I just noticed that it wasn't easy on him and then like I said, it would take him to work more hours which was taking away time with the kids and I'm just like, that was not fair to them, because you ask and where is your daddy, he is at work, and he was always at work. So, not a lot of home time.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So who initiated the separation?\nUNKNOWN: I did.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You did. Oh you did, okay. Can you tell me about that? How that happened?\nUNKNOWN: We had issues. We've been married for eight years so far and within the first two years we began having issues just with my family like me separating from my family and realizing that I had a spouse and so I was like leave him to go do things with my mom or with my sister, or you know, and I didn't realize that in his childhood he was left alone. So that, he never really discussed that, so that brought about problems, but -- so I was saying, we got married in 2005, around 2007 we would argue a lot more and just have like disagreements and -- and then July, when I left him, July 2013, I had just returned home from a trip to Atlanta and when I was down there, it was just peaceful. I stayed with my cousin and it was just, I didn't have a care or worry in a world, it was just -- I was able to really relax and I started reflecting on things that I was unhappy with and when I came home that night we were talking and he was actually going to tell me that how much he missed me, how much it was hard with the two kids and me being gone and I beat him and said, oh, I want a divorce. We talked about it for like two hours and he appeared to be calm about it and said, okay, we began talking about what happened and it was actually kind of I -- because I didn't expect for him to just be so calm about it, but the next morning when I left he unraveled, so did I, but I still chose to leave, and honestly I do not regret my decision because now we are becoming better friends, because in the marriage we lost our friendship, like I no longer considered him a friend, I wouldn't talk to him unless it was need-to-know basis. So now we -- we are actually better communicators right now than when we were married.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So do you kind of see this as a process, like you're not intending to get divorced anymore, it's just okay we're in this developmental phase of our marriage where we need some distance and work on skills and we'll get back together at some point?\nUNKNOWN: I'm not sure, like, if I want to get -- I have reservations about that, I told him that how do I know that if I've decided to come back, things won't be as they were, because I began to be ignored, like he would ignore me, the sex lacked, the sex really cut off, and just -- we wouldn't even speak, we lived in the same household, but we wouldn't even speak and me working with young children I know that that's detrimental to them as well. And my daughter would say, well, you didn't give mummy a kiss or you're being mean to mummy and I didn't want them to have to go through that. So I'm very reserved right now. I'm just letting him know that I just strictly want to work on our friendship, get our communication levels back up to where they need to be.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: So I'm not really sure on if I'll divorce or if I'll reconcile.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: I'm not sure yet.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And does he -- is he clear about what he wants or is he unsure also?\nUNKNOWN: He wants his family back, but he also wants me to be happy. So it's kind of like a double-edged sword. At first when it -- the first couple of months he really tried to pressure me into coming back just because he say, how much he need me, how much he miss me, but it just wasn't, it ain't feel right, so I stood at my ground and he finally began to realize that I needed space and I needed time, because in the marriage I kind of felt that I didn't contribute a lot, he has always made more than me, he has always had a education, and there wasn't a lot of support in the marriage when I would choose to do things like even going back to school, he was not very supportive of it. I'll need quite time to do homework or to study and he would be watching the game, so he couldn't like care for the kids, they'd always come and, well, mummy I need this, I'm like okay, I'm trying to study, go extra day in. So, that was one of my major reasons for leaving, he was very unsupportive and we couldn't communicate. I would be nagging as he said and I'm just like, well, I'm trying to express how I feel. So yeah, so he's starting to see and now he's starting to see how well I'm doing with school, I'm graduating next month. I'm -- like I mentioned straight As, so he's seeing that I am developing into my own person and now he's trying to support that. But give me my distance -- my space and just be more respectful of me as a woman.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is it that -- does he still live in the place that's 45 minutes away?\nUNKNOWN: No, he actually -- the same week that I left, he left. Him and my uncle are like the best of friends, so he moved right over here in Park Forest, so he is now like 10 minutes away from us.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. And do you take turns with the kids then, they go back and forth?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And he is a good dad?\nUNKNOWN: Very.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Very involved.\nUNKNOWN: His work schedule is still -- is kind of off, but when he is off on weekends or if he has days off, he will get them from school or he will keep them on the weekend and whatnot.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So I imagine you've had a fair amount of pain like sort of emotional upheaval and pain with this and this kind of -- like have you then kind of roller coaster feelings with...\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Should I stay, should I not, try again, not.\nUNKNOWN: A lot of people thought that it was sudden, like a lot of people thought that it was another man and someone telling me what I should do, and it was not that, it was just no one really knew what was going on, we were able to mask it with a smile, but it was just like a, I got tired. And so, I have been saying this for about four or five years, I just never really said it out loud, I'll always just say it to myself, because I wasn't -- honestly I was scared to leave, because I didn't know what would happen, I was -- I'm a very sportive woman still I am. So I'm used to, like I say, him billing me out if I needed him to. And so, I always thought if I leave what would happen, will I fail, I was scared of failure. So some days I would be happy and some days I was like, okay, I'm not at a good place.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Well, and just a reality of that, you having two small kids...\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: ...and being on your -- there is a lot to manage when you're working and going to school. And do your parents help them with childcare?\nUNKNOWN: We live with my parents, me and the kids live with my parents, so my mom keeps them at the school and she has a very, they've -- her and my kids have always been close. Her and my daughter are a day apart in birthday, so they have like a real mother and daughter bond themselves. So, my mom keeps them.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. How are you sleeping?\nUNKNOWN: I'm not comfortable, because I was out of my parent's house for five years and then to have to return because that was rarely a last resort, I don't want to get comfortable, because I don't want to stay an extended amount of time, I want to go and get my own apartment or my own townhouse, I want to be able to fully provide on my own for me and my kids. So, I sleep on a couch, I refuse to buy a bedroom set for myself, even though I can have my own room, I refuse, so I won't comfortable and relaxing to be there more than a year.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Hmm, okay.\nUNKNOWN: Because this is my mom, I kind of feel like comfortable. So I feel like a lot of things I don't have to do, because that's my mom and she won't make me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you're just trying sort of new behavior to be more disciplined?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: And I just bought a car this week and my very first car on my own.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Good for you.\nUNKNOWN: So this is teaching me -- my car notes are higher than I expected, so this is going to teach me disciplined with my finances, which I need.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Good for you, wow. You're motivated.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How would you describe your energy level?\nUNKNOWN: It's often now some days. If I really get good night's rest, I'm pretty high energy and some days I just feel really lazy, but I also can attribute that to the fact that over a couple of years I've gained more weight than I've ever weighed, so just tired sometimes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Are you doing emotional eating?\nUNKNOWN: I did. I stopped after about two and a half years. I didn't even realize that that's what I have been doing until I started noticing that my cloths weren't getting bigger. Like, I've buy bigger sizes and no one ever said anything until I was just like into this size, I'm just -- you know, this is different for me, but I'll recognize that it was -- I would, whenever I will get angry or sad, I would emotionally eat.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. What would you say are your strengths or supports and that could be these are sort of the things you've gone for you? It could be religious, cultural, personal, kind of internal strengths, faith that kind of thing, anything in that domain or people?\nUNKNOWN: My own internal strength is the motivation with my school and I'm doing better than I've ever did in any of my years of making these grades and being able to like post my midterms on a refrigerator like a kid and my kids saying, you know, I'm proud of you mamma, that motivates me a lot. The fact that I can do it on my own. I don't need help with my homework, I understand it, mom -- the fact that I'm able to retain information, I would also say the fact that I'm very well at what I do as far as work. I'm a very good teacher here at Governors State, they saw it out from me. So...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Really?\nUNKNOWN: That really speaks volumes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, really.\nUNKNOWN: I'm one of the teachers over there who's always work the Head Start, so I'm able to trying and get some of the others.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, wow!\nUNKNOWN: Just the fact that I'm a very good communicator, but I'm horrible at listening.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh.\nUNKNOWN: And my support, my husband, he's supportive now. Now he is. And my favorite cousin, who lives in Atlanta, she is very supportive.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And church too then? Would you say -- you said...\nUNKNOWN: When I go.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. You said you had written on the form that you're a Christian and...\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. For a lot of times for people, religious, it can be the support at the church that's really the supportive piece and/or it can be sort of the internal faith aspect of it, kind of connection to spirituality and higher power and is it all those things for you or any one aspect more than the other?\nUNKNOWN: Just the fact that, knowing that I can pray and really sit and watch at either counterpare(ph) or it -- maybe it's not for me, but after the separation I went through a period of rebellion from church and from my prior life and it was more or like, well, this isn't working for me, so why should I continue to pray or why should I continue to go to church. Or it was more -- it's more of when I feel like going or when I feel like praying, I will.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So do you feel like you're still in that rebellion?\nUNKNOWN: I'm coming out. I just started back a couple of weeks ago going back to church. It started with the co-worker inviting me back, so I'm starting to go back at my own will though, but my prior life has increased back, but actually going to fellowship with other like-minded is a slow process.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\n[sil.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So while you're talking, I'm kind of listening for the major stressors in your life, the things that are really hard and it sounds like the separation is one, then parenting, I mean would you include that too?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Two small kids. Okay. You love your work, but working full time and then going to school, would you say that's stressful too? Kind of balancing all that?\nUNKNOWN: With me going on online is not so much stressful, because I have deadlines but it's not like actually going on to a campus, so it's more tiring, because I need to come home from work at 6:00 PM and make sure my kids homework is done and make sure they have dinner and get them off to bed and still try to fit in a little bit of time for them before they go to bed and then I've to jump straight on the computer to do homework, so it's tiring which kind of drains me, because sometimes I don't go to bed till 2:00 AM. After that -- and I haven't time for myself.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. And I would think, I think of those things has contributing to your stress level when you don't have the -- because then you don't have the -- as many internal resources sort of to handle it, because you're just tired.\nUNKNOWN: And my health, like I'm physically healthy, I am, but I eat horrible, because I don't have time till I come and cook.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: So I grab something or some nights I might not even eat at all. If it's between hungry and sleep, I might choose sleep.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You got to choose those things.\nUNKNOWN: And then I wake up with a hunger headache or something.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: So I just know that my health could be a whole lot better and I think that my ways are my confidence level with will.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And then how about living with your parents? Would you say that's stress force?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: They are small girls, I'm not. I don't -- my children love my parents and they always want to be under my parents. And we -- I have allergies, because my parents have a dog, so really -- their smoking bothers me the most, because I don't want to expose my children, I mean just reek of smoke constantly, you know, and I just -- I failed with my mom about not smoking around them or but it's her house, so I can't, like, you know, tell her what to do on her home, but I push it. I do.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh. And then, you didn't specifically say finances, but is that a stressor too?\nUNKNOWN: Being down to only one year, both of my kids are in school, so I don't have to pay daycare fees, but I do pay my mom and just being at the level of work that I am, we are not paid a lot, so I really have to budget more than I'm used to. And when I can't get something, I'd tend to spazz out just a little bit, even if I don't show that I'm- I'm I'm constantly just wrecking my brain or how am I going to make this work or how -- living from check to check is horrible. And that's I've been doing that and it's hard.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you -- so I didn't specifically ask about anxiety, do you feel some anxiety from time to time or you know?\nUNKNOWN: Only when something major is coming up.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nUNKNOWN: Like holiday, it's Christmas time, I get a little anxious around then or...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Do you drink alcohol? If so, how much?\nUNKNOWN: Occasionally. Maybe a glass of wine or maybe one or two a week. If I go out, I may just have a glass, because I'm normally the driver. So...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. How about powders?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No powder, nothing else?\nUNKNOWN: Nothing.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. How much caffeine do you have?\nUNKNOWN: I probably drink two Pepsi's a day maybe, which I'm trying to stop that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, so only soda.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

I used to have at least four bottles a day and when I would try to stop I would get the jitters and I shake…\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, yeah, okay.\nUNKNOWN: So, I know there is not...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you do know that. You've experienced it in your -- yeah, okay. So I'll put here. Weaning off of it. Okay. Well, is there anything I haven't asked about you think that's important to include here or mention. And you can tell me in other sessions too, but...\nUNKNOWN: Okay. Well, since we have already spoken on one thing I would like to -- I'm kind of battling with my mom, I told you that. Just two years ago, I told her that, I was molested by my biological father, and she had already known and it really pissed me off, because I'm like you continue to send me to his home. He has always lived with my grandparents, but she continued to send me there knowing that it happened and her justification for that was he was drunk that night and she didn't think that it would ever happen again, which has not, but that was not a guarantee. It could have happened again and I felt that she was placing me back in harm's way. So I still haven't been able to wrap my mind around the fact that why she would continue to send me there, but I brought up the fact that I don't think she noticed that -- my father's sister lived like nearly over a hill from them, from him and my grandparents, so I still wanted to go out there, but I would go and stay with my aunt and just visit at my dad's for maybe a little while, but I would never spend a night over there again. And I also told my mom...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Your choice that...\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. Because I was no longer comfortable, so I would go over to my aunt's home , and also with my brother I just really been thinking about the reason why we have so many issues, because we grew up really close as kids, it was only us two for a while. I think the reason why we have major issues is because he was lying in the bed when it happened to me. And I think that, he was paralyzed with fear, he didn't know how to help me, because I cried out, and I know he -- I'm just sure he was awake and maybe he was, you know, he didn't know what to do, so he couldn't move, so I think I've never spoken to him about it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh.\nUNKNOWN: But I'd just sit back and I think that maybe there is a reason why we don't talk, because he has never been in a position to need to protect me or anything. I've never, you know, put myself in a position where I needed my brother's protection except for that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And how old was he when that happened?\nUNKNOWN: I was 9, so he was 10.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nUNKNOWN: Well, actually I wasn't even 9 yet, so he was 10, I was going to be 9 that September, so I was eight.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You were just eight. Okay.\nUNKNOWN: So I really think that that's what the issue is with the two of us, the fact that he remembers but he's never spoke on it either.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you haven't ever spoken to him about it?\nUNKNOWN: No I was encouraged by my mom, well, really my mom thought that I was blaming him, but I wasn't, I mean he was a child, so there was nothing that he could have done, but you know -- but I do want to talk to him, but I kind of think that he has a very short temper. So...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you said, you're sure he remembers.\nUNKNOWN: I'm sure.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How do you know that?\nUNKNOWN: Because he was lying in the bed and I'd just can't imagine if I'm yelling out, that he wouldn't hear it, or he wouldn't wake up, there is movement in the bed, you know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: So.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nUNKNOWN: Those are just my thoughts, but I do want to talk to him but I don't know how to approach him with it. Like I said, he has a -- he has a short temper and not -- maybe not necessarily with me, but that's his defense. That's how he is defensive, so he gets attitude or he yells and fusses.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Well, okay, so let me stop here, okay, and summarize. You know, when I'm trying to understand a person's life is sort of what they're going through, I look at three things. The first thing I look at are -- is, vulnerability to say anxiety, depression, stress, you know, anger, that kind of thing based on childhood experiences and you may have some vulnerability to that. You know based on this experience with your dad, I'm not sure -- what do you think about that?\nUNKNOWN: It's, like I said, this happened when I was 8, I'll be 30 this year, and I'd just spoke on it two years ago. And the only thing that made me say something was, my aunt, who's my father's sister called me and asked me, did anything ever happen? Because they found out that he had done it to one of our cousins when she was nine years old. So that brought me to go ahead and say, okay, this happened, you know. And so, then they needed to go down like, okay, well, who else has it happened too. So I've -- I'm my father's youngest daughter, yeah, I'm his youngest, and I kind of have a connection with him like, he is really a me-man but not to me. So I just tried to see the good in everybody and I get the term burnt alive, because I just see the good in everybody, even if they show me bad, I still trust and say, okay, is still something in you, I tried to be a positive person, even when I'm stressed, I try as hard as I can to be positive, but -- so...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So with regard to sort of vulnerability based on childhood, that's kind of a maybe -- I mean, it sounds like that, that -- well, it sounds like there is a link between those experiences and childhood with your dad and currently some of the stress you're feeling. So, okay. The second thing I look at is our stressors, like the kinds of the things you have in your life going on that increase your stress level, the pain level, and you have a long, long list. I mean, you know, I'm writing them down, numbering what you're saying, you know, talking there is the separation right now, there is a parenting of two small children, there is working full time and going to online school which, okay, maybe it's not those things and themselves are not super stressful, because you're good at your work, you look it a lot, you're doing the school from home, but they're still really tiring which depletes your energy level. Then you've got the, your health issues, the recent weight gain, which bothers you, the living with your parents again and that they're smokers and have a dog and you have allergies, so that connects with your health too and your kids health. You've got the finance stressors and then you've got the conflict with your mom since this whole thing has come up about your dad, and then also the sort of feelings around your brother too, kind of the conflict with that sort of reemerging or getting bigger.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, that's a lot. That's a lot of stuff. And then the third thing I look at are supports, like how much support you have. And that -- because one thing we know in this field is the more support you have, the more stress you can handle, and vice versa. If you don't have a lot of support then even daily, small stressors can feel pretty overwhelming. And you have, you know, you said your sister and your cousin, your husband, but that's kind of you know not a completely stable source of support right now giving your separation. Do you have any close friends that you talk to or?\nUNKNOWN: No, my sister and my cousin are my closest.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Your sister and your cousin. Oh, and church has been the source of support in the past?\nUNKNOWN: Yes. When I moved back out this way I left the church that I was at, because it was over a hour away, so just not being able to get there twice a week like I had been, you know faithfully, yeah.\nPAMELA A.

HAYS: Okay. So, yeah, you could probably use some more support.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It sounds like. So you know given sort of your price and vulnerability based on childhood and then these enormous number of heavy-duty stressors you have and pretty limited support at this point, I don't think it's surprising that you're going through some emotional ups and downs. In fact, I think you're doing well considering what you're dealing with right now. So then that raises the question of, sort of, where to go from here? Like, what would be helpful, what to do about it? I used this approach that looks at problems in two main categories. The problems are sort of solutions. So the first category are the -- those that you can -- where you can decrease your stress level by taking some action, it could be changing something in your environment, it could be changing your behavior like learning some new communication skills, conflict resolution or a certain skills that help you in your -- decrease stress in your relationships, it could be self-care activities like not just physical but emotional spiritual self-care kinds of things, it can be increasing your social support, so it can be a variety of things in that domain and help people figure out what would be small steps you could take, actions that would get you going on the right path. I kind of think of two paths, you know. There is this path of wellness or wellbeing, and then this other path and we want get you going there, or move you further down that path, make that path be -- your life is that path, you know. So then the other category are those that you can't do anything about or you've done everything you can for now. That's like a medical problem, that you've done everything medically you can, but you're still stuck with it or person, another person, you know, you can only do so much to change somebody else's behavior, you can change your behavior, but you can't really directly make them do anything or behave differently. But with those kinds of things we do know that, there is one thing that helps, we know that the way we think about a problem affects how we feel about it. So, there are things that you can say over and over to yourself or ways you can interpret people's behavior or events there -- that -- those ways of thinking and self-talk that help you feel better, sort of more encouraged even though the problems are still there, but there are also ways you can talk to yourself and think that and interpret things that really pull you down, make you feel more helpless and discouraged and afraid, and so on. So help people figure out that piece and now that's not about the sort of happy positive thinking, it's really more about realistic thinking, because when any of us gets -- youngsters are depressed or really anger, we tend to skew towards the negative, so we don't even see the positive, and this is really about thinking more realistic. So you recognize that, you do have lot of challenges, but you do see positive possibilities in this, you see options, you're able to reflect and remember your successes and hold optimism and about your future. You know, so help you with that piece, too, kind of that self-talk piece. And then I usually have people do some sort of homework or practice exercise between sessions and we use that as a gauge to see whether what we're working on is helping and if it is to increase that more and if it's not kind of tweak in or find something that works better.\n\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Well, I guess it wasn't a week; it was a just couple of days.\nUNKNOWN: Good.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How the homework go?\nUNKNOWN: Good. I almost forgot like I remember like just as I was stepping out and I'm like okay, I remember now, so I just took this up.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Did it, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, you did the prayer in the shower?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, oh good. How did it go?\nUNKNOWN: It was - it were fine. It went longer than a minute.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, really?\nUNKNOWN: Because I started to think about other things that I was like grateful for and thankful for, so I just like fused in with the calmingness and yea.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is your prayer often about gratitude?\nUNKNOWN: Not all the time, but it's been a lot of good things going on. So, I just want to remind that I'm thank full for that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's very nice, yeah. There is an exercise that I do every day. I've been doing it for about four years and I started doing it because I read it was linked to people feeling happier and wellbeing and I call the attitude of gratitude exercise for your list. I do five things a day that I'm grateful for, but yeah, I think it's really good -- good thing to do.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It does -- it does trying to change your mood.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. So think about the good things, instead always listing what's wrong, so much more brighter things.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, when you here last time at the very end, I asked you so what is it you want to focus on, what do you want to work on in the sessions we have and you have said, one thing was to learn to listen better and then the other thing was to learn skills or ways to sort of calm your spirit. Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, is that still the case?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Those two? Yeah. Where do you want to start today? And what do you want to start with?\nUNKNOWN: Listening skills. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Could you give me an example of a way in which the -- your difficulties with listening create a problem for you?\nUNKNOWN: Like when the truth can hurt at times and sometimes when someone is telling me something about myself, that I kind of like ignore. I don't want to hear out, tune it out or I'll try to switch the subject or, sometimes I even be like ignore and walk away depending on who I'm talking to or just like blow it off, like yeah, yeah, or whatever. And that's not fair, because I feel that I can give criticism even if it is not constructive. So, I should be able to accept as well, but sometimes I don't or like sometimes I'll get like I will get a attitude how act he is if, I'm not upset. But I know that I'm and people close to me know that I am. So, I just need to know how to just hear them out. It might help me things that they tell me about me may help me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Can you give me an example of the time that it has that you've been able to listen and hear something that was kind of hard to hear, but in the end it helped you.\nUNKNOWN: Parenting skills, living with my mom, she notices how much I may fuss. At the kids and warning so she just -- I remember been a child, my mom will wake me up with the song, so --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, that's nice.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, she tells me now, she I just go on to kids, wake up, come on, time to get ready for school.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: So, like they have favorite songs, so I just like play a song on YouTube in net, they wakeup happy, so I just really listen to her because my daughter doesn't like to get up in the morning. She don't. I literally like 15 minutes sometimes it will take her to get out of the bed and she's still dragging and I don't want to get up. So, now when I play her songs, she is happy to get up. She starts her day off better. So, just having my mom, I'm just sit back and constantly hear me fussing she, you know, she just saw me wake them up in a different way and it made me think that's my child, well she used to wake me up because I was in the same idea I want to get up, stay in the bed, I'll drag out of the bed, but here her I'm just like yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: When your mom did it with you, did she sing?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh. What was she sing for?\nUNKNOWN: She sometimes -- hello and I think off it's time to go to school today, school today, school today, it's time to go to school today, get up, so you can learn. I was just like okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's nice.\nUNKNOWN: It used to annoy me at first, like I don't want to get up, I just want to hug my pillow, but it helped.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, yeah.\nUNKNOWN: So, now that's how I get my children help out either sing to them or might took them away again or just play the song of YouTube.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, well, it so good. That's really creative.\nUNKNOWN: Here we are growing kids, you got to learn different ways you know to help them up.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do your works.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, definitely.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Well, yeah, and you'd be good at that too if you work you know those things, yeah. So, with your mom, do you generally take criticism from your mom better than other people or?\nUNKNOWN: No, I actually take it a little harder than her because I was raised under my grandparents. I was raised in my grandparent home, when my mom started date her fiance. He actually live next door to my grandparents. So, she was spent a lot of time next door, so in that -- for like that was couple of -- I don't know if that was -- I don't really remember if it was mine, so maybe even a couple of years. She would be over there a lot. So, I was always under my grandparents, so it was kind of like, well, you don't know what's going on day to day, so how can you critics me, when you went there every day. So, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that's kind of a belief or something you've held on to your thought over up until now, you mean that sort of influences you when she says something critical or --\nUNKNOWN: Yes, some -- with me I have older brother, I have a younger sister. I'm more matured than both of them like my maturity level just surpasses them and they're telling me I was like -- you're acting just like her. And I was just like, well, you know, I'm just -- I don't want to say wiser, but I'm more experienced than my siblings. So, my mom to me, she gets on me a lot and I always feel that she's like ragging on me, like dragging me down, I'm just like, I'm the one who did everything correct, you know. I'm the one who got good grades in high school. I'm the one, who went straight to college. I got married before I had kids, you know, so I'm just like why do you rag on me so much. But it's because she sees the potential in me and she knows that I can go so much farther than, where I am and she just have been found the proper terminology to like help me, in that manner, because sometimes she will just -- she is not mean or you know, she doesn't really say anything harsh, but my listening hears things as harsh and it's really not there so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know I teach classes and on some kind of hot topics, sometimes where defensiveness comes up. And I've just said, I think defensiveness is one of the biggest obstacles to people connecting. I'm -- I'm trying to kind of think about people's pain or hurt, I like the saying, it's the greatest source of human -- the greatest source of human unhappiness is disconnection from one another. They only feel disconnected from another person, it just -- we're sort of made to connect as human beings and that feels good, when hey you get me, yeah, I get you and so when we don't feel that or something happens that breaks that connection, it feels bad. And with your mom, I'm wondering if that's the kind of feeling that kind of comes up for you that sort of defensive feeling, where you've been pulling yourself -- pull into yourself or want to lash back.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Was it in a physical level like you actually had to defend yourself physically?\nUNKNOWN: Sometimes. Sometimes. Yeah, sometimes, and recently maybe about two Christmas' ago, like a couple of day before Christmas, me and my older brother really got into a fist fight.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh!\nUNKNOWN: Like I don't challenge men, I believe that men are stronger than women and they -- the level of respect you should never challenge a man that's just my own personal thoughts and believes. But he does something to my son there I'd disagree with. I didn't like yell at him. I just tell him, I don't like that, please don't do it again. And he lashed first, which caused me to lash, but I couldn't believe it like saying back thinking about like even the night that it happened I was completely like, I just -- my mom was like what -- because we were literally at the dinner table, my parents, my kids, my brother, we are at the dinner table and a fire breaks out. And I had sort of like said back and I think like at what point I don't even remember getting up out of my seat, gone over to him and hit him, I didn't remember that I literally like solve it really like people say all the time, but for that's actually happened, I'm just like well, you know, well and I during the fight, he was not trying to hurt me at all, he was trying to calm me down, but I was really trying to hurt him.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, you like punched him or something?\nUNKNOWN: Oh it -- oh we -- I fought him. I clawed him, I beat.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Really.\nUNKNOWN: I did everything I could, because he was holding me, so I'm get off from me, but even after that my parents broke me apart, I went after him again, because I was so angry. But I wasn't angry with him, it was just so much I've built up.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh yeah.\nUNKNOWN: And it just happen, and I'm just like, I can remember my kids all sit aside, they were -- I can see them, I can hear them just a little bit. They were crying and I couldn't stop. And then I just got in the car and left. I just (inaudible ) and we left. I was just like - like see it was there I think about this wow, I can't believe that they happened. Because when you used to play -- fight as children, but we're grown, we're adult and I literally flipped. So I'm just like, but again he provoked me at that moment. He provoked me and then my parents again oh cut it out because they saw me get up and I heard them tell me to cut it out. But I didn't know that was about to happen. But again, they -- he did something to me and they ignored it. So, again I had to defend myself and also my son. So, I'm just like here it is -- what at the time 27, he is 28 and I'm just like, again here the situation is again, my parents completely oblivious. And I'm just like now I've to defend again.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, is this kind of thing not happened since you were kids.\nUNKNOWN: Right, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's why I was surprising.\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You haven't really had even arguments or anything with him.\nUNKNOWN: No, not really.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Like, you know, we argue sometimes, but it was never substantial. It was more of brother, sister argument over whatever we argue about before it's actually give physical to the mater of me really trying to hurt my brother, I can't believe it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, did you tell me last time he lives in Japan?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No, oh okay, I was thinking he went overseas or something.\nUNKNOWN: I wish.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No, I don't know how do I got that, but anyway so he lives right near you then.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, he lives close.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, you've had interactions with him periodically over time.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay.\nUNKNOWN: I see him. He will come, spend night in our house with - he has a son now. So, my daughter always calls -- acts of her uncle, can come spending of, so he will come, spend a night once a week. Yeah, so I see him. I see him on Sundays at church, you know, when I turn and we talk you know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But you did say, when he lived with you, you had conflicts right?\nUNKNOWN: That were there.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Even he did -- you and your husband didn't. I mean he and your husband didn't, but yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Right, it was me and him\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, yeah. Are you ever able to have sit down and talk with your bother that feel like good, a good connection, you know, where you really can talk and like a defensive.\nUNKNOWN: It depends on like what we're talking about. Me and him, we don't have a good -- we don't know how to communicate with one another, but if it's something like regarding our family or like a friend or something, we know how to sit-down and talk about that, but it's like once that conversation, we're like done we're off the phone. We have nothing more to talk about because my brother is a type of person, where he wants you to listen to him and I'm the type of person, who listens but when I try to speak, I don't want to hear about that. So, he was just like, leave it alone and I'm just like, okay, I gave you, your turn and you know. But it seems to work, but it doesn't work. It's not proper communication and we both know. But we are not always arguing now, we -- like I said we do know how to communicate and talk about whatever we need to discuss, but it's not -- it's never a lengthy conversation. It's like need to know quick and we're done.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, when he -- in this case, he wasn't listening to you really?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right. And did he even -- kind of dis you to, I mean like I don't care what you want me not do with your son or --.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, it was fun, we were sitting and having dinner, he had earphones on and my mom -- my son picked up shoes and my mom told him to put them down. My son is not the person just drops something he puts it back together as it was. And before I knew it, my bother like did this to my son's ear and that bothers me because it was done to me by my grandmother in my childhood so I don't like to be flicked or popped. You know like to pop his ear, I didn't like that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Why did he do that?\nUNKNOWN: Because he thought that my son was not putting it back down.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh!.\nUNKNOWN: Quick enough, but I'm just like you're not even paying attention, you have your earphones, your face is down on your plate and you can't see out of your eyes. So, like, why did you -- and I just -- I was on the phone at the time, so I just simply tell him, please don't pop him, I don't like that. And before I knew it like my mouth started bleeding. I'm like, okay, why is my mouth bleeding. He had threw a bottle at me, a bottle of salad dressing and it hit me and I looked to the side of my, where did I get there? Why was my mouth bleeding? And it connected, he threw the bottle at me. My parents didn't see at those, so like I said before, I knew it I was up, I walked around the table and I hit him back and we just started fighting.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, that's a pretty big thing. I mean he threw a bottle at you.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, it is. And I'm just like.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Where did that come from? But then I found out that - like the same day, him and his living girlfriend had gone to a really bad argument. So, it was kind of like he already was upset, but I'm just like still really, you know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So, he didn't apologize or anything huh?\nUNKNOWN: Not that day, it took him -- it took him a couple of months to apologize. He actually -- after that he went outside and kicked two really big dents in my car and I did call the police. So, when he found that the police were looking for him and that he had to pay for my car door, he apologized like maybe three months later.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: The police didn't come now or do anything.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Did they, do something to him?\nUNKNOWN: No, they just filed the report. I don't want to charge, I don't want him to go jail. You know so he still my brother. I don't want him to go jail. So, I just filed a police report just to show the incident happened. What happened as a result to my car, just so, if I need him to pay it. It was documented.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that -- I'm wondering is that an example of where you want to good listener or I'm not hearing like you did anything really wrong.\nUNKNOWN: Well, my mom told me to -- she told me to stop. Don't start but --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay wrong.\nUNKNOWN: But I had already it. I had already it. So, I really bypass because they were trying to break it out and I wasn't listening. All I knew was, I wanted to hurt him. That's all I knew, is that I was not listening to kids cry, yelling from my mommy to stop, I was not listening. I heard it just a little bit, but my own anger surpassed all of that. But I never been angry like that. I had never ever been angry like, I don't believe in allowing a person to get me to that level.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: You know because things happen and I'm a mother, I'm a wife, you know, I have to lead by example and for my children to be right there and witness. They still talk about it's whose day and I just say, don't worry about it, you know, it just a misunderstanding, you don't worry about it. But his eye --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: If that's the only time you ever done anything like that, are you -- are you thinking that's because you got all these stressors, and if all these things going on you just kind of, yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah because in my family they -- I am the calm one. I'm the level ahead of one. I'm the one who -- so they think. They think that I know how to deal with things better than them and I am the strong one. But they don't understand that every person has their day, you know, no one thinks about the stress that I may have is like, oh well, I'm here supposed to be strong, you know, like my sister looks out to me, even don't my brother want to admit it, he does too. I'm the one, who can handle death in our family, but I handle in my own way and with him putting this amount of pressure, because it is pressure it actually be the strong one, the one, who cares everyone, the one, you can come to me, you need anything. That's a stress, it really is. So, I have to keep this for side, as if I'm okay. I have the class, I just smile on my face, you know, I'm okay. I can get through it, and I can help you get through whatever you need to get through. But they don't know the night that I cry.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: You know the time that I've spent, crying or sad or worry, you know, they don't -- I don't think they will think about that. So, it's stressful, very stressful.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It sounds more complicated than just you need to be a better listener, you know. I mean, I think your brother is throwing a bottle and hitting you in the mouth and it bleeds that's, you know you should be a very good listener and I supposed your mom said, cut it out before he did that?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, before I stood up. She didn't she him throw it. But she saw me standup and she told me, I took off my jewelry, I took off my necklace, and I took it off so when get broken.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, like you are in -- you battle?\nUNKNOWN: I didn't know that. I did not know that I had done that. I took off my wedding ring. I did not know I had done that. So, she was telling me, I kept telling you to sit down, sit down, but I didn't hear it, because I wasn't trying to hear, like I said, I saw red, I was angry and I wanted to hurt him. I did not hear anything else going on. But just other than that situation like I say, at times where people may, you know, try to tell me something about myself, you know, ways like what my husband if -- if I hurt him in some way unconsciously like we talked about finances like that. I heard him because I told, he has pretty more hours at work, like when he bring that up, I don't want to hear, I was like - oh well, we're just worked extra hours or I won't do it again and then I do it again. So, it's like I'm hearing, but not hearing and listening are two different things, so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know, it's interesting you would give the these two things that you're saying you want to work on. I have seen -- I think I'm starting to see the connection between them now because it's -- if you are super-stressed like you said, you want to work on relaxation and calming your spirit. If you're super-stressed, it's really hard to listen because when you're super-stressed you're -- you just you're on -- you're on, you know, there is a guy who has written a book, I think his name is Sapolsky called, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers. And he says that, if you think of the zebra out on the Savanna and the lion is encroaching on him, what happens? Well, the zebra's whole body gets flooded with adrenaline and all the blood rushes to his muscles, to prepare him for a fight -- for a flight to run away and his immune system gets a boost, because he might get injured like and needs that. And then and then he takes off. And so his whole body marshals the energy to escape. And he escapes and he gets away from the lion and then this whole sort of nervous system calms back down. And he is okay, but this guy says, the guy, who wrote the book says, human beings, is a similar kind of thing that happens, when we feel like we're under attack and a lot of times the possible attacks are more social than really physical. In your case it was actually a little physical too, but. But the difference with us humans is that we have the ability to think about what just happened.\nUNKNOWN: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, then we start to worrying about, what just happen we think. Oh, gosh, that was really scary. That could happen again. What if that happens to me again? We keep the adrenalin pumping and then we worry about, oh and that was really, really horrible. And our, you know our adrenalin level is just like this. We just keep the stress going in ourselves. And I'm wondering it for you, if you kind of got that going on, right now, you got real external stressors on you, that are pumping up your stress level. And then on the other hand you may be doing a little bit to yourself as well, sort of mentally in terms of what you're saying to yourself or thinking, yeah. What do you think about that?\nUNKNOWN: You spotted one.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh was it, okay. Okay. Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, sometimes you know, you're helping me, I may not be able to think of it, like you can, but which you're saying sounds really about right\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you -- are you aware, when you start to feel, sort of, some sort of emotional upset or distress or pain or something? Are you aware of where you feel it in your body?\nUNKNOWN: In my head.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: In your head?\nUNKNOWN: I get a headache really quick.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Where?\nUNKNOWN: In the front.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right up in here.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, right in the front.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, yeah.\nUNKNOWN: And normally I don't get headaches and I don't like what we take -- I don't really take medicines. But I have to take like Aspirin or Ibuprofen for my headaches, which really just is not like me. But lately I bring the headaches. And sometimes I don't want to eat, so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: This approach that I using therapy, which I described to you. I don't know if I told you was called cognitive behavioral therapy or not? Yeah, have you heard that before?\nUNKNOWN: No.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

So, I yeah I'm going to have work on simmering down that's it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know, I have this a little exercise I do with people, it takes about 3 minutes, it's called mindfulness focusing exercise. And I'll tell you what it is and you tell me if you want to try it or not. Basically have you closed your eyes for about 3 minutes and with my voice, I sort of walk you through that area, where you hold tension and in your case it would be the -- your head. And have you just pay attention to it? It isn't relaxation exercise. It's really more of a paying attention exercise, along the lines of what I just described that guys says, you know, your knot tighten aside. So, you have to -- first start paying attention to your body, before you can start to relax it. Would you be willing to try it?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So, for this, yeah, you want to be sitting comfortably with your feet grounded, and then your hands comfortably in your lap. And do you feel comfortable closing your eyes?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So, go and close your eyes and as your eyes are closing I'd like you to focus on your breath. Can you notice the sensation of air as it moves in through your nostrils and out through your nostrils. You might notice that the air feels sort of cooler going in or cooler going out or you might not notice either. This is just a noticing exercise. You're not trying to make anything happen, just noticing. Will you like to do next on the inhale at the top, of an -- of a breathe. Hold it for a count of two, so 1001, 1002 and then exhale through your nose. Do another breathe like that we hold it, at the top. And then just return to your normal breathing. And as I'm talking you might notice sounds around you, like the sounds as the lights are just noises in the room and that's okay, you can just gently pull your awareness back to your breath, when that happens. So, now turn your mind's eye or your mental awareness to your forehead. Connect the top of that area, where you feel the stress retention into the top front part of your forehead. And I'd like you to just notice anything there is to notice there. It might be a different color or sensation or vibration and there might not be anything different at all, and that's okay too it just a noticing kind of exercise. And as you're doing now, walk your mental awareness around to the right side, kind of the upper right side of your forehead, around sort of to your temples. And then connect to the bottom of that area, it might be around your eyebrows or sort of middle of your eyebrows. Again noticing anything there is to notice? And then bring it around to the lower left side -- the lower other side and continue to walk it around, that side and then kind of the upper part of that side and back to the top. And again you're not trying to make anything happen, you're just noticing. And now also look at this space from the front to the back, you know its three dimensional, so go from the front of your forehead in through your head towards the back, noticing anything, there is to notice. And then coming back forward to the front.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Not likely it return your awareness to your breath, the feeling of the air moving in through your nostrils and out through your nostrils. And then just kind of where go your toes and move your feat a little bit and your hands a little bit and you can blink a little. When you're ready to spring your awareness back in to the room.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What was that like for you?\nUNKNOWN: I didn't notice that the breathe was cooler going, coming in, and with the forehead I noticed that, I don't have any pain in my head today.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh and you didn't, when you started either?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: And I think about, I have not had a headache, all day today, because I have not have to take any type of pain medicine.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is that fairly new for you, when you do it a lot?\nUNKNOWN: Yes, because this is the end of a day after work and I don't have a headache.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Was there anything else you noticed? I'm not -- and I'm not looking for anything in particular, people are really different how to have this.\nUNKNOWN: I just notice that the breathe is cooler, of course I've heard the noises within the room, but just the fact that my breath was cooler, coming in, rest is going out. And the fact that I did not have any signs of a headache even on coming.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How do you feel right now after having done it?\nUNKNOWN: Well.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Do you feel any calmer?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You do? As in more relaxed?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, because now I'm thinking about my day and I had a lower class today. I had a few students so, it was calmer at work.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that could be a reason, why you didn't get a headache, yeah? Well it's not surprising to me that you feel a little calmer and relaxed after that, even though I said more than once this is aren't to relaxation exercise, right? But there is something about, like that guy said, you know paying attention to the knots we hold, that there is something about just listening to your bodies and kind of paying an attention that is -- it's a calming experience somehow. Are you familiar with the concept of mindfulness, have you heard of that?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It refers to paying attention to the present moment without judgment. So, you just pay attention to the hearing now, and paying attention to your body is a good way to do that, just what's going on in your physical experience right now. Without any judgment of it, you know, not that, oh! that's terrible, oh! that's not good, oh!, whatever if it - just.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Just it's it is what it is you know. And there are something that's kind of calming about that and one of the ways people, places people take this then, is to start to use it in their lives kind of generalize it to other things, that when you're doing something, you just do what you're doing don't try to do too much you want, you know, don't try to multitask or you know -- if you're talking to your child about what happened in school today that you aren't checking your phone while you're talking to your child, what happened in school today.\nUNKNOWN: And that's exactly what I do.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Check the phone, during dinner, eating dinner on the phone, checking the phone and try to talk to them, try to check their homework at the same time. That's four things going on.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's a lot.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And it's a lot of mental energy and physical energy too, yeah. There are some things that we can multi-task with them, I mean most of us can walk and talk at the same time and things like that. But multi-tasking for a lot of things is actually an allusion like, you know, that's the reason for texting, I don't know if it's legal here, but.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. Texting and driving, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, texting and driving, because you have the illusion that you're doing both, but actually what's happening as your brain is switching back and forth, so you're slower, so your response time is slower than if you have to hit the brakes.\nUNKNOWN: I just had that happening last week.\nPAMELA A.

It's hard -- it's hard to focus, but if I include that and like a daily routine, it will be a better practice and a thousand thoughts may minimize down to one. So, that I thought I'm definitely going to start tonight, you know, definitely.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh! Do you wanted to try this exercise you mean?\nUNKNOWN: We can, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Do you want to do that as homework?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh! Okay. Good. So just wanted to make sure that it's like a 100% doable, you know. When would you do it? When would you have time to do it?\nUNKNOWN: Today is Wednesday. I don't have any homework tonight. So, after I lay my kids down to bed, whether or not spring breaks are out, put them in the bed about, between 8.45 and 9.00 o'clock. So, I'll say between by 9.15, I'll be able to sit and have quiet time.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: The nice thing about this exercise its really short. I mean you can do it in three minutes.\nUNKNOWN: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I didn't timed this, but I don't think it was even five. And the other thing is you can do it too, even in places, where like you're in a meeting or something. Oh, we will say, your head start, playing with your kids and one kid is doing this over here and the other kid is doing in the Teachers Colony over here and you just kind of take a deep breathe, go in to your stuff a minute and go, okay. You know, it's just a mindfulness second kind of thing, just to help yourself, -- it's kind of a calming thing, just pay attention. And for you, it might even be taking a breath and listening to your head.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Paying attention to your forehead and then if you notice that you're really feeling the tension there, it's just kind of take a breath and see if you can let it go with that a little bit.\nUNKNOWN: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's kind of a next step like the relaxing piece of it, but I think if you just do this focusing thing once that would be great, just practice that.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah so, okay so that will be the homework then.\nUNKNOWN: Okay. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: For the next time, okay. And then we are set for--\nUNKNOWN: Friday.\nPAMELA A.

HAYS: Yeah?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, I was in a busy restaurant and I took a mindful moment.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good. That was kind of what I was talking about right. You don't necessarily have to have the quite, five minutes of quite.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, it worked better than I expected because at one moment, I just didn't hear the click-clacking of forks and spoons, instead of I just was in a moment, I was with my children and my husband was there. So we were just, I just took a moment to just find peace for a second.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And what prompted to do it right then and there?\nUNKNOWN: I thought about it, yeah. Just -- it was just like a quick thought, like okay, let me do it now.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you think it had anything to do with the clitter-clatter, clacking of the -- all the noise and everything or --\nUNKNOWN: Well, not really. We had a nice waiting period, so maybe that's what it was.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Mm-hmm. Huh, so you found the peaceful spot.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Good. How long do you think you did it, like five seconds or ten seconds?\nUNKNOWN: Also about 15 and 20, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Good for you. It can be pretty powerful experience once you start doing that.\nUNKNOWN: I hope, I'll see.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: It felt odd to be sitting in a crowded place and just took a moment and then I just like sat back in kind of, feel like sat back in.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I can't remember if I explained this last time or now, this idea of, when you start to become more mindful, doing that kind of an exercise to kind of find that peaceful place that it often sort of bleeds into the rest of your life, you know, that you then -- when you are in another stressful situations, it just sort of comes to you too that, okay, just be in the present moment, no judgments. Just be here and now.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, along the lines of the goals you've outlined which were to learn, to listen more carefully and grow your coming spirit, is there any direction you wanted, any focus you wanted to take today?\nUNKNOWN: There is a lot going on. I can't -- I can't remember all that we talked about since Monday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, that's okay. I have questions for you too, but I don't want to go off on one direction, if you want something -- very immediate.\nUNKNOWN: Today was a very peaceful day. I opened this morning, which is a change for me because I normally start at 10 but today I opened at 6:45. So just to be there before, I think, there was maybe three other people in the building. So just to have that moment to be, in my classroom and I was able today to gather everything that I was going to need for the day, get everything. So it wasn't -- felt like I was running once the students got there, running to get pain or get this, everything laid out, which is good because normally, I am not the opening person, but usually even we three of us, we were still kind of like running around, but this morning, I had it all planned out. So that was a good moment for me. And the day went smooth, very smooth.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Was that a surprise or have you known that when you have opened in?\nUNKNOWN: It's been -- it's been a long time since I've opened. So today, it was just -- I finished quicker, then I thought I would -- I was able literally, I got there at 6:45. My first two students came in at 7 and I had everything, so in 15 minutes, I did a sweep of the playground, I got my everything done, every supply I needed to be put away, cleaned everything. I was even able to check e-mail for a second.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, wow.\nUNKNOWN: So I am like I lose some 15 minutes and I did not have to like rush through it or anything. I just kind of had a focus on what I wanted the day to go like. And so basically I have set the tone for the day and it feels good, because like I said, I am not the opening person, so I am coming in to the room that's kind of chaotic already.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That sounds very mindful, the way you started the day, that way, you just did what -- what you were focused on in the moment. And you didn't have to rush it all and just helped to feel peace about the rest of the day.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, I have like -- like my supervisor text me last night, and I was like, okay, don't forget the checklist, and I am just like okay, so I didn't even need the paper to show me what I needed to check. It's like automatic, I knew what to check and it was just a breeze pretty much. So like I said, it set the tone for the day. My students were very calm because I was calm, and even when I got ready to leave, it was -- we had a fire alarm. Someone burned popcorn and it set off the fire alarm, but in that time. So my students were still fine. They still came back in, they still took their nap and it was very eerie kind of, because I'm not used to a Friday being this calm, but it was, and I was thankful for it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you think there was kind of an interactive effect, like there was something about you they were sensing different?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Really?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's interesting.\nUNKNOWN: Because on a normal day, when I come in, there is twice over here and there is kids making this much noise and I'm trying to bring them all together and get them to calm down. So we can move about the day, but sometimes it's harder, which stresses me or like gives me a little anxiety and I am -- I'm just like, oh, today is going to be a bad day. But by me being the opener, me setting the atmosphere, I had the music planned, so yeah, I think the key, it's fed off of me today.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know, I think that's a really good example of something I think about wellbeing or wellness in general that it's not just a self-centered thing that when you try to grow well being yourself, it tends to ripple out like a pond. You know, it affects other people too. There is -- there are studies that show that when people are happier, when they are well, they tend to be more generous and more patient and kinder. And it's just something's easier when you are more relaxed in the moment.\nUNKNOWN: That's true. And I got a phone call like 10 minutes to eight, my husband had a car accident. Someone hit him from the back, but even, I was able to calm him down, you know because, he was really upset, he was like, she was driving so fast and she wasn't -- there were actually eggs in the ramp to get off. But I'm like calm down. Just make sure you are okay, check everything, get all the reports that you need done. If you need to go to the doctor, just go and call me later. I'll check in with you later. And I just spoke to him a little while ago and he was headed to the -- he want to work of course, but he was headed to the doctor, he was like okay. I am calm, you know, I'm calm, so I'm like good because being stressed out can actually think your body is in more pain than it actually is because like you told me, stress, we carry it more. I'm like, it was good for you to just set that moment to -- like take a deep breath and relax. And I am -- I was glad that I was able to help him do that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Mm-hmm. That's really nice to hear. Sometimes, when I am working with people over time, they start to feel better and then they'll come in, and after I haven't seen him for a while, and they'll say, oh, it was a great week, nothing bad happened. And I always say, you know actually that's not we are working towards here because that's not life. Bad things will happen. What we're working towards is, helping you to weather the storms so that you do well even when those things happen, that you get through them. So this is a really good example too of how you did that even though you got hit by this unexpected stresser. Yeah. And so your husband's okay, you said?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A.

HAYS: Mm-hmm. Good. Well, there was something you mentioned towards the end of the session last time that I had thought about. I want to ask you a little more about. You started talking about how, in your family, you are the strong one. Everybody sees you as the one to go to and you are expected to -- not buckle under stress, that you hold up and you follow through, carry through. And that can feel, this is my word I think but, it feel like pressure like, sort of a burden to carry.\nUNKNOWN: Definitely.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So -- yeah. And I think you said something like, this is -- maybe now, this is a question, okay? I had the impression that you could see that it kind of feels good to you to be seen that well. So there is part of you that kind of holds on to that role too, yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Yes. Yeah, just I mean, just to have, I guess someone look up to me, to know like in an event, she is walking (inaudible ) she could be the voice of reason, or a calming factor. So I like it, but just a stressful part is sometimes, they call me for everything and they don't try to figure it out on their own or they are not mindful of how I may feel like after -- afterwards, after hearing about it or having a talk about it. Sometimes they are just not mindful.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Do you let people know when you need something?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No. Anybody?\nUNKNOWN: My cousin, but she is in Atlanta. So -- but, yeah, hard really. Maybe my sister, maybe it depends. Sometimes, she is just not in a position where she even has the mind frame to listen. So a lot of things are holding into myself, which is stressful because sometimes I just wait till all boils up. And I'm just like, okay, well, you know no one asks me or no one thought about anything. But it's kind of hard, like I say, going up busy in my house, kind of say, competition with my siblings and disputes and whatnot. So it's just kind of hard to like open up and just express my leads or sometimes my feelings. So I just --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, yeah, you had said because of the way you grew up with your kids and your parents reaction to their bullying, that you really developed this sort of defensiveness and -- yeah.\nUNKNOWN: And I think a lot of part of that is sometimes, I don't see anything, just like, really who cares. And right now, I have this thing where everyone has their own problems, why should I dump mine on yours, which is not necessarily me dumping my problem. You will just listen to it and see if it's really worth me by stressing out or spazzing out over it. Because something maybe big to me, but once I sit and reflect this, really a minor issue and sometimes it just takes for us a while to say, okay, you know, just think about it this way or look at it from this point of view.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right, but I mean if you don't tell people, nobody is going to say that, right? You have to sit -- and it is a lot harder to deal with it, just inside yourself. I mean, a lot of times when we hold things, and it stews and gets bigger and bigger, yeah. With your friend in Atlanta though, you are able to do that. You are able to be vulnerable with her?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And that's really what's it about? Being vulnerable?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is it?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, really -- yeah, it is, I mean, because like I said, I am a strong woman. I don't want anyone to see me as a weak link. Everyone has the vulnerable moment, but if people really knew how often it might work, they are like, it's kind of like a title, and I'm like you are not taking my title from. You know, I mean, it really sounds petty, but I mean, this is how I've been raised, this is how I've been conditioned. I mean, here is a strong one, you know, but I think those who really, really know me, which I am sure, my family know me much more than they let on. I am sure that they can tell when I am having -- when I'm having a rough patch, they can tell. They may not say anything. They -- I know, like sometimes with my mom, she waits for me to come to her because she don't want to feel like she step in all my toes or whatever -- and whatnot.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, so it's almost out of respect kind of --\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, or kind of just like I am await to see how long she goes before she comes and says anything.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, like I could take that two ways. One would be sort of mean way, seeing how far she can go, but you don't mean it that way.\nUNKNOWN: No, I don't think my mom is being mean, but I just think, my mom knows me, my mom knows that I am stubborn at times and she knows sometimes and my mom, it's all despair. I need to humble myself and ask. And just sometimes that's hard for me like I could use a financial example. I needed -- what did I need? I needed like a couple of hundred dollars to do something, something major needed to be done, but my brother wanted tire -- he wanted new tires for his car and I was working at the time. And my husband, we were both working, but we just needed, just a little extra help until time came we can repay. And my brother, he was not working, he will literally just drive -- just drive around, and my parents chose to give him the money, for him tires, and I'm just like. He is not even going on anywhere significant and here it is, we're trying to make it, you know. So one day, we can get out of your house and so it's like with their situation, it's like okay. If I can't get it, I either don't need it, or I have to wait for it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did he ask for it?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, my brother asked for it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did you ask?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh really, so you've asked and they said no.\nUNKNOWN: I asked and, yep, they chose to help him. And I didn't express how displeased I was, but within myself, just what I just told you. I mean, he is literally just driving around the neighborhood and I am going to work, I am trying to -- I was working two jobs at the time and I was pregnant. So I am just like, we really just needed some assistance and they chose to give it to him. So sometimes I just hold back or I just keep with the thought that if I can't get it right now, then it wasn't my time to have it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Ah-hah. With your parents in that situation, were they trying to make a point or something, were they upset with you or your husband?\nUNKNOWN: No, my brother is a brat and it sounds crazy speaking of a man, but he is, he is spoiled, and as we both are, but he pouts about it whereas if I was -- I wouldn't pout about it. I would just find another way, but he doesn't. He holds grudges and he would get attitude and sometimes he would not even like speak to us or whatever. But I'm just like, you all raised him that way and at one point you guys have to cut it out. You have to cut the task to make him feel that, okay, you need to, but yeah, at that moment, he would have had a fit -- attitude and -- yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So it's a kind of got him conditioned then too.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. Not my dad. My mom --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, or your dad doesn't fall for it?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, so it's your mom who gave him the money.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But they look at you as the strong one that you'll figure out something?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, should be okay. Having -- still have a relationship, good relationship.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, I don't -- I weren't taking it as serious as I'm talking to someone just because they want to really help you out. I try not to like count other people finances at the same time. I mean, maybe they wanted to help both and couldn't, but I am more understanding, I am.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So you do ask for help sometimes, with your parents, you don't always get it. Sometimes, you do with them or not?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: So do you want to hold onto that title all the time, or you're thinking, well, okay, maybe I need to let the title down occasionally and let people know?\nUNKNOWN: No, I don't want to -- you know, I don't want to hold it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nUNKNOWN: It is really not an official title. It was just something -- it's just like a preconceived notion kind of, because I may not openly express how I am feeling or you know, when something happens, I may not cry about it in front of people. So they just kind of have this thing, well, she shows no emotions. So maybe, she is just a little better built for storms. But it is just that I don't show it in front of them. I have my moments, you know, I am like, I was really close to my grandmother. She was really like my mom. And when she passed away me, me and my son had just left, had just left from her home and all of the family was there, I didn't realize that. They told me that she was going back to the hospital. I didn't realize that she had been sent home or hospice. She died five days after my 23rd birthday. And I mean, I knew that she was ill. So I was prepared, but of course, when a loved one die, you know, you still have your mom and so that night, in particular, it was a Saturday, we were going out to dinner for my birthday. And when I got back to the house, I got the phone call that she passed. And I think, I maybe cried for like maybe two minutes. And my son, he was a toddler. He kind of put his hand on my back. And I stopped crying, but then, at the funeral services and whatnot, I didn't mourn to like maybe two or three years later. It will be six years this September and I mourned maybe two to three years later because my aunts and my dad, my dad lived for her, so he was really taking it hard. So I had to really stand for the both of us. But that was a hard moment, but nobody thought, well, me -- and momma, because my aunts call her momma, no one thought, well, you know, they were really close, let me just really see how she is doing. Like everyone got something of hers like maybe her favorite hair scar or for maybe like a purse. You know, I am just thinking my mother really loved purses, I took nothing because I just held something more than a material thing, but no one thought maybe she will like this. No one thought about it. Well, she's okay. you know. Everyone doesn't -- I have to realize that everyone doesn't think like I do, which is good because you know it sets us all apart, but I wish that I would have been thought of in that moment there were given things out of hers, I wish that I would have been thought of, but I wasn't. But it's okay. It is.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So I see this strength in you as kind of a two-sided coin then, which a lot of strength, qualities are too, that if you go too far with it, it can work against you and it sounds like it may work against you sometimes when you don't let people know your needs. And I used the word to be vulnerable with people. I mean, it does make you vulnerable when you let people know that your feelings are hurt or that you're short on money or that you can't do something that you promised to do, you know, yeah. And I see that it's something that's really important in a relationship like in order to connect, people have to be able to share their vulnerability, share their needs, you know, be vulnerable, yeah. Would you agree?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. They have to.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Being in a marriage, yes, I definitely agree. With him and I, like I say, things in his past, he brought into our marriage and I knew nothing about some of them because he had -- he was unable to share them. So he was not -- I would say vulnerable enough to open up that far, because it was deeper than what I initially thought it was. So it was -- it created a lot of problems where I'm just -- I had to -- opened up and talked about, maybe a lot of things could have been spared, you know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, yeah. I see that it's coming out of fear a lot of times, you know, fear that the other person won't love them -- love me or something like that, if they really knew who I was or really knew what I did or whatever. Yeah. So how about you with him? Did -- were there things that you couldn't tell him, didn't feel you could be vulnerable with him?\nUNKNOWN: I'm an open bird. I'm the type if a person asks me and if I'm comfortable enough, I'll tell you, and even if I'm not, give me a little bit of time and maybe I'll be able to open up and let you know. But with him, we were friends first. We didn't just jump into a relationship. We were actually -- we built the friendship before we even started dating. So I was really comfortable enough to share like, I shared the fact I was molested by my father and he took it harder than I did. So just the fact that I was comfortable enough to share that with him when I just told my mom two years ago that really -- it really spoke volumes. So with him, yeah, I was very open with him.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you have -- I mean, some of that's about sharing information, but also, you shared emotional stuff with him too, which is like you do with your friend in Atlanta. So he is another person then that you can be vulnerable with.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. Yes, he is. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Or maybe -- oh, okay.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. He is because, like I said, we are -- even though we are separated, we still talk a lot. We still talk a lot. Like at dinner in the other night, we -- I told him about the sessions here and we just converse about it. He was like, well, even though it's not like a long-term thing, he was like, I'm glad that you're actually going to talk. So he is encouraging.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good. Okay, yeah. One thing I find a lot with women and then especially women who are mothers is that they're taking care of everybody else and they often don't think about taking care of themselves, you know. And you see the connection to kind of letting people know your needs and taking care of yourself that if you are taking care of everybody else, you don't have any needs, you know, that are important. Everybody else's needs take priority.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, definitely. And that causes -- that causes friction, because like with myself I felt, I'm taking care of everyone else. I'm going to school, I'm going to work, I'm a full time parent, I'm a wife, taking care of the house, cooking dinner which I really hate to do, but I'm cooking, I'm keeping the house clean, I'm shopping, I'm doing everything where all these different sleeves, carrying all those different stuff, but what about me? And I kind of feel like that's why I had like a drastic weight gain because I was so busy taking care of everybody else, I didn't notice myself like I literally put myself on a back burner. I'm not blaming anyone because I just feel like, I mean, that's just a role I play. You know, I have to take care my family, but I have to take care of myself as well.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. And in fact, if you don't take care of yourself, I mean, think of where that can go. If you really don't take care of yourself, you'll get sick, right, eventually. And then if you get really sick, then you can't take care of anybody else. So there is a -- there is a medium in there, some sort of happy medium that you have to take care of yourself to a certain point. But it sounds like, this is -- this is more of a question for you that you may need to pay more attention to that, paying -- caring -- doing self-care kinds of things for yourself to help build your strength to take care of all these other people.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Mm-hmm. Are you saying that this has been about self-care too for you, like take -- paying attention listening and --\nUNKNOWN: Over the last couple of months.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, inside and really realizing what you need to keep going?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. Over the last couple of months, I would say, yes. There is a saying, if mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy. And I know that in those days, where I lived in Chicago and my lights were constantly off, my blinds were closed. I wasn't dressed. My kids, I will get up and fix them food, but there was no interaction. They were not happy. My husband will come home and things were not as they were, like dinner will be cooked, but I may have just left it or the kitchen may have not been cleaned, I just did not want to. The only thing I'd do on a consistent basis was did my homework because I knew that I need to make -- keep my grades up. But other than that, I was not doing anything and that was just like I'm working on myself, I know what I want. Finally after all these years, I had known exactly what I want and I'm going for it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Mm-hmm. So do you see yourself as in kind of a transition place where you're trying to figure out, get this done, the way to do good self-care -- take care of yourself and take care of other people that you love?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay.\nUNKNOWN: I'm trying to figure it all out. I have friends who say just do all before you're 30. I'll be 30 in September, so I'm just trying to really make sure that we are taking care of, as best as I can be able to do it, but I'm not excluding myself this time.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. What do they mean by do it all before your 30?\nUNKNOWN: Basically mean that in your 20s, it's easier to ride off like, oh, yeah, I messed up, I'm only 20, you know, But by the time you're 30, you know, that's another milestone. So I'm just like, okay, I'm going to be right, and like I said, I'm including myself I'm not going to sit myself on a back burner. I have to be just as happy as everybody else and really other people, especially my children, are happier if I'm happy.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So remember last time I talked about the path is like the wellbeing or sort of wellness path and then the other path. It sounds to me like you're really on that path and you're -- part of your challenge, your particular challenge in being on that path, is to figure out a balance between taking care of yourself and taking care of other people, yeah?\nUNKNOWN: And also on staying on that wellbeing path.\nPAMELA A.

HAYS: Can you tell me the positive part, the beginning part first?\nUNKNOWN: I was able to get out with my best friends. Saturday was a beautiful day, where we went out to dinner on Friday, and kids then really enjoy themselves, and then Saturday was such a beautiful day, we really gone all day, and day and night towards the Saturday evening just went downhill.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What happened?\nUNKNOWN: Disagreement with a friend.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is this the best friend from Atlanta?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No. Oh, okay. Different good friend.\nUNKNOWN: Hmm.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Well, were you able to do the homework?\nUNKNOWN: Yes. I didn't get a chance to take the bath like I wanted to.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, just a hot shower sufficed, you know, so it was fine.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. I was thinking the homework was that you would do the focusing exercise, so was it a self-care?\nUNKNOWN: I did both.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, you did both.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. Wow, homework plus. So you did the focusing exercise?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Once or twice or --\nUNKNOWN: I did it twice. I did it Friday night, and then last night.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What was the scenario of each time you did it?\nUNKNOWN: Friday, what was I doing on Friday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You were here Friday, so it must be after that?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. Well, my brother came to the house with his baby. So that was a good time. When I just took him while(ph) I was in the midst with them. And then last night was, I was just really upset, and just like a mom, when she tried to relieve my feelings.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did it help a little?\nUNKNOWN: Not at all.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. So you're still feeling bad about what happened Saturday night?\nUNKNOWN: That and today is my son's birthday, and I was on social media, and I saw a picture of my deceased cousin, and I forgot that today was also his birthday. So, it just kind of had me in a down mood.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, yeah, well. Those were the same days.\nUNKNOWN: Mmm.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, do you want to focus on anyone of those things?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No?\nUNKNOWN: I want to cry, so --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. Well, do you want to go back to your goals, the ones you said at the beginning?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. The first one was to be a better listener, and the second one was to find ways to calm your spirit, relax, huh.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. You know, with regard to the -- well, and then we linked them, when you were here last time too, because you were given that example of your trouble listening to your mom and that conflict with your brother, and I said you know, if there was one time thing you've never exploded like that before, that sounds to me more like you're super stressed and this is a result of that. You know, not to say that, I mean, you -- there may be other situations in which you need to be a better listener, but there is a link there between those, it's hard to listen when you are super stressed.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, then we've talked last time about the kind of self-care activities, the mindfulness exercise, and then also the self-care stuff is a way to keep moving down that path of being healthier, happier by taking care of yourself. And I think I mentioned that, I think, of self-care in terms of three areas, like, physical, emotional and then spiritual also. And you agreed that you don't think much about self-care for yourself.\nUNKNOWN: Right. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yes, that's for yourself, that's what self-care is right?\nUNKNOWN: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You think about other care?\nUNKNOWN: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Taking care of other people.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: When you think about it now about self-care, do you think in terms of those three, the spiritual as well as emotional and physical?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You do?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. Just try to get myself back, like we talked about me not going to church as much. So now, I'm pushing myself to go. And with the emotional, it's kind of hard, it is weakening, but normally it's kind of -- it's being embedded. I just -- today was just an emotional day for me. I just woke up, and which is very emotional. And I didn't understand, why? And then when I saw the picture of my cousin, I'm like okay, well, that can, you know, be another reason as my son's birthday as well, you know. So it was like kind of like time which is moving on.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, post you had the thing with your friend, Saturday night, I mean, there is a cumulative effect of those things too, you know, that can only handle so much hurt.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: It's just been with that, it's just been continual arguing, and I'm just like, okay, I'm just turning everything off, like, no way to get in contact when I have my phone off all day. And no one has my work number besides my Mom.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Arguing with who? The friend?\nUNKNOWN: The friend, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. But anybody else?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Just the friend.\nUNKNOWN: Mmm.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you said the spiritual self-care that's going to church would be a big piece of that if you started doing that again.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did you go yesterday?\nUNKNOWN: No, I didn't get a chance to go yesterday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: But I do plan on going on, well Friday, for Good Friday and also Saturday, I'm going to go back to the church, we were going to, I'm going to drive back out there. So that we go to see them again.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you have church services on Saturday then?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh.\nUNKNOWN: On Sunday, I go on Sunday, Friday and Sunday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you -- where you are going at Saturday then?\nUNKNOWN: I'm not going Saturday, just Friday and Sunday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, oh, okay. Yeah, kind of nice, it's Easter weekend then too, huh?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That would be a special weekend to start.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Will your kids go with you?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Will your husband go to?\nUNKNOWN: He is beginning to work on Sundays again, but he has his own church. They do a feeding program at his church on Sunday. So he goes and cooks for the feeding program, they feel like the home was. So he does there as early Sunday morning, so at the time that he's doing that, I'll be gone to my church.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So is this a church where in the other town you lived in?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. How far is that?\nUNKNOWN: Now, it will be like 45 minutes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: But I really want to see them, so that's why I'm driving out there.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that would be something that would be spiritual, self-care and emotional too, right.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It would really kind of build you back up.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, definitely.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Help you feel stronger, and -- yeah, that sounds like a good thing, then. Yeah. Are there other things that you do for spiritual self-care or emotional?\nUNKNOWN: I try to pray as much as I can, like I said there is no set time of the day that I do it. I like sometimes driving at work or just when I think about it. And like emotional, I can't really think anything in particular that you know self-care for emotional. Nothing is just like jumping out of me like, oh, this is what I do for this. I'm not sure. Today, even though it was an emotional day, it was really calm, it worked. I had less students and the ones who are there were just very calm today. So that kind of helped. I don't know if it's like the weather, but it helped. It's just such a calm day.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Were you pretty subdued to?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Because you were hurting?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

It's more like I found myself smiling at them a lot today, because I just saw them doing little things, like I saw another child in another class room. He was just standing outside my door, he wasn't looking in or anything, but I just saw him, he started smiling. So it just the little things today helped. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What other kinds of little things helped?\nUNKNOWN: I was -- I had like a little mirror for -- I have a baby. We play with mirrors with him, it's probably like, not a big mirror. But I have -- he is non-mobile. When I have a mobile toddler and I was playing peekaboo with it, and when I put it back over my face, and put it back down, the mobile toddler was like directly my face and I didn't know he was like there. And when I put the mirror down, he was smiling so that of course made me smile. He caught me by surprise, because daily we hear him walk over, but when I put the mirror down and saw him smile at his own reflection there, that was so deliberate that made me smile.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Was he surprised to see you?\nUNKNOWN: No, because he was watching from far, I didn't.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nUNKNOWN: But actually he was watching me. So it was funny.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: He was not so little, he had that thing, you know, babies however they -- when they don't see you're not there, and then oh.\nUNKNOWN: No. He knew because he had been seeing me playing with the other baby. So he was more like, let me go get in on that. And so I thought that was funny.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's nice.\nUNKNOWN: So that was a smiling moment.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: And just another thing. They have just the fact that they were so calm. It was helpful, because had they been like, you know, really hyper or like really again into things, more explorative, a kind of would have been just a little stress, but it wasn't, very calm, really good nap times.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I think you said earlier to that you -- a lot of times your prayer is about gratitude. The things that you are grateful for. So what's that, did you notice that, then it was like something, you said thank you for it today.\nUNKNOWN: Yes. And my co-teacher who was in the class room next door, we don't have like a wall dividing us. So we were able to talk all throughout the day, and she said it a lot of -- I was down, so one student by 4:30, which is not rare, usually by 4:30, I have 6. So just to have that one baby and she was like, wow, you know, saying us how your mood is, you know high today, it was good that you had a low day and now you're only down to one, and we rocked in the rock and chair, he went on to sleep. So I was able to get some cleaning around the class room dirt. So yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And there is something really soothing about what rock in a baby.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: I really just want to lay my head back and close my eyes, not to sleep, but just like bask in a moment, you know, just such a soothing moment.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. These things that you are describing I think of is mindful, mindful moments. You know, you're in the moment when you notice something like the calmness and the quietness of the kids, and you say, thank you for that, you know, or you're in the moment, when you just to lay in the funny -- the kid's looking back at you, you know when his laughter, in the moment when you suddenly notice the rain or the kind of cloudy weather out, the quiet, yeah. That's good. So you already do this mindfulness thing.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. But I don't know what it was.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, yeah.\nUNKNOWN: It helps.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you know there is the other piece of that, being in the moment. The other piece of mindfulness in addition to that being in the moment is without judgment that you're not being judgmental about anything in the moment, because so many times we're judging, you know, like, it's cloudy out, and oh, I hate that, or the kids are quite, but wait till tomorrow, you know, there is something negatively add on, but the mindfulness is you just stay in that present place. And I read somewhere that when you're in the present moment without judgment you're not worried about the future, because it's not here, right. You're just in the moment. And you're not worried about what happened yesterday, because it isn't happening, you are just here.\nUNKNOWN: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: The weather is a little depressing to go from 75 degrees on Saturday, so 40 with like, I don't know what was going on outside, like I feel it wasn't raining, because it was kind of hot something and like you know, forming snow just like -- but I still chose, not to really just bask in a negative, so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, it sounds like you took that, because that was a bit of a shock for everybody, I think.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But you took that and just -- you looked for the part of it you could appreciate the kind of calming effect that cloud your sky brings.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, it does.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So this is good, these are all things that -- sometimes I'm not sure what the -- if there was a line between emotional and spiritual self-care, I mean, there are a lot of the things you do for emotional care, I think help your spirit and you know vice versa. So being in the moment, you do that, and the prayer, and to go into church, and what about the physical too self-care?\nUNKNOWN: I was able to go get my hair done, that always makes me feel good, thank you.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good, good.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. Me and my daughter, I took my daughter with me, and while I was waiting I went on to her and washed her hair, which was the first time for her getting washed at a salon, I usually do it in a bath tub. So just to see, she was really afraid at first, until I showed her how it would go. And just let her know, you know, it's fine, just lay back and relax and to see her, have a big girl moment, just like that. That was fun.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And they will give you a little massage when they're doing it.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. So I did the same for her, just what I'll get, and I did the same for her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good.\nUNKNOWN: And she enjoyed it, she wasn't scared or anything after I started, so that was good. And I did a little shopping this weekend. Just being out was good, just being out with the sun, and you know, the nice weather, it was just really nice to be out.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That was on Saturday, right.\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So after you had this kind of rough Saturday evening, were you thinking about self-care on Sunday?\nUNKNOWN: No, because we were celebrating my son's birthday yesterday, I took the kids to the movie and out for pizza, so it was more trying to, you know, not be sad around him, because it was, you know, his special day to go out, so it was more like, let me put these feelings off to the side. Just soaking, keeping about face for him and his friends. So it's kind of what I did. And then last night, I fell at sleep really early, I turned my phone off, I didn't want to be bother at all. So I just -- I went to bed extremely early, which is not like me. I think I was in bed by 8 o'clock. So that's not like me at all. And I saw messages coming through to my phone, phone calls, and I just ignored all of them. I just -- the sad moment came back, the hurtful feelings came back, and I just wanted to just like sleep it away.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Well, it's soothing to go to sleep. Sometimes sleeping helps to like you have a fresh perspective in the morning and --\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Yeah. So it helped a little bit this morning?\nUNKNOWN: Just a little, not as much as I wish it could have, but battling -- I found myself battling out feeling, because even at work, I have a co-worker who's really -- she likes hugging, and it's fine, because I normally like it little, but today, I just did not want issues like, well, I love you, and I'm like I don't even want to hear that word. And then the other one was like, well, how was your weekend? I'm like I don't even want to talk about the weekend, I don't even want to hear the word weekend, you know. Because one moment, pretty much ruined the whole weekend for me. So I'm just like I don't just want to talk about anything.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know, this kind of reminds me what you said last week, and the last time about being the strong woman, the strong one who doesn't have feelings.\nUNKNOWN: Right. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Her stuff some.\nUNKNOWN: I just, I felt that I needed to at work, just so I wouldn't be sad, because I work with children. They do feed off my energy. And I just didn't want to think about it at work. I was a lot more quite today like some of my teachers came to find me like, well, we haven't seen you, because normally I step in every morning and say good morning to everybody, or just step in throughout the day to see how everybody's doing. Today, I just literally stayed in my class room. On lunch, I didn't go into the lunch room. I went and found a quiet corner to cry. I called one of my best friends and I just cried to her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good. Okay, so you let yourself do that.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, good.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, just for that moment. Yeah, I did.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What about last night? Was your husband around?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No.\nUNKNOWN: You know, we live separately.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I know.\nUNKNOWN: So, I actually, I had to call him because I was having like really bad chest pain. And I just called him just to let him know, he was like, well, do you want to go to hospital? I'm like, no. You know I'm like I'm not in pain enough to go to the emergency room, but if I feel that I need to, I'll go ahead and call you when I end, before I knew that I was at sleep, so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you think that was anxiety?\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I mean, pain hurt like the emotional hurt.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is that -- does that happen to you sometimes that you have, like a tight painful chest, when you're hurting emotionally.\nUNKNOWN: No, normally I would just get a headache. But I just think that argument was just like really hurtful, and not heartbreaking, but that's what you would think if I have pain, and the left side of my chest, you would think like heartbroken, but, because like I said, I'm not like argumentative type. You know, I don't like that, I don't like anyone to being angry at me. It really just bothers me for someone to be upset with me, but some things are just out of my control, so I'm just like, it will kind of hurtful the way things ended, like ending a friendship was hurtful.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is it -- is the relationship done, like, you won't be friends anymore?\nUNKNOWN: I'm not sure, I kind of like said it out of anger, but I kind of meant that at the same time, but I just think like overtime, you know, it may heal itself, maybe it just needed sometime apart, maybe I'm not sure, but I can only manage my feelings, I can't manage the feelings of others.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How long have you've been friends with this person?\nUNKNOWN: A little over a year.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay, not a real long time.\nUNKNOWN: No, not a real long time.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, I'm glad to hear that you were able to give yourself the time to kind of find a room and go cry, and you said you talked to your other friend too, then about what it happened, and is there something else you need like, I heard this, I had this sort of book that had deep questions, and it was kind of real simple book, and every page was a question that you ask yourself, and this is a -- this one question kind of stood out to me, and I thought of it just now ask yourself. What does your soul need?\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nUNKNOWN: I saw something similar to that today. Something really similar today.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Really?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. And it was actually been hanging in my classroom for months, and I never read it, but today, is something similar to that, that was like a caution. Especially speaking of calming the spirit, a kind of linked spirit and soul in the same. I would say, seeing these all what happened this weekend, I would say that my spirit needs forgiveness, like, it's easy for me to forgive others, but like I say, will someone be angry at me, it's like, all I can do is I assure them that I'm genuine with what I do, and I've never tried to hurt anyone intentionally or unintentionally, so I think once that person realizes that, then maybe things will get back on the right track.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you mean your soul needs that forgiveness from them.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: The other person, yeah.\nUNKNOWN: And I was same kind of selfish when I think about like, like I don't like people being angry at me, and sometimes like well I try not to, but I could say, well, when they are angry at me, and they're listening what I did, I'm like well, you did this and you did that, and I try not to go tit for tat. But it happened this weekend, it really did. And I'm just like I didn't wanted to go there, but it played out and I'm just like, it's just like -- because I'm sad.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, forgiveness from somebody else is something you can't make happen really, but I suppose there are things you could do that could maybe facilitate, or make it possible if the other person was willing to do.\nUNKNOWN: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know that you come towards and they come towards you. Are you seeing anything that you wish you done differently?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah it wasn't at the right place, it wasn't at the right time, it was actually at a friend's birthday party, but it just -- it just seemed like everything happened so fast, it was like, I just said something like something that bothered me, I expressed myself something that bothered me and the tables turned. Sound just like --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Any other --\nUNKNOWN: I mean I didn't yell or curse or anything, I was just like you know what, this bothered me. And it was just like a switch, like it turned into like the blame game, so here we are going back and forth, about what, who do you what and how it happened, and how it felt made us feel, but nothing kind of accomplished. Besides the fact we said okay, we are not talking anymore.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And that was you that said that.\nUNKNOWN: Both.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: She did too.\nUNKNOWN: Both of us.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Are you kind of similar?\nUNKNOWN: No, actually he's a guy. No not similar. No not similar at all.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah okay. Why just I asked that because you both said that.\nUNKNOWN: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I'm not --\nUNKNOWN: Tried not talking to you.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I'm not talking -- well I'm not talking to you, you know like if you tend to be able to just like cut it off like that.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Hmmm.\nUNKNOWN: That's exactly what it was. It was, like I said it was a blame game, and that just doesn't work for me. I mean I'm the type of person, if I've done something I like to own up to it. I can admit when I'm wrong, and I can accept the fact that I have hurt you out, you know do all I can to apologize, and show you that it was not meant, you know meant, because I never tried to hurt anyone intentionally, you know so, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I find very often in defensive re-interactions that both people are trying to -- both people feel like the other person doesn't get them, doesn't understand where it come from.\nUNKNOWN: That's exactly what he kept saying, you just don't understand. I'm just like, well, help me understand, what is it that I'm not understanding, but I don't think he understood, so he couldn't explain.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right.\nUNKNOWN: What I didn't understand, so I'm just like, okay. That's where I just kind of felt like he wasn't owning up, so what he done. So I'm just like, you know, you are trying to push it off on me, you are trying to blame me, and I'm just trying to get understand, and you don't understand this, so you can't make me understand.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Often when people get into that kind of an interaction there is, person A says their thing louder, so to try and get their point across, or repeat, you know and then person B does the same thing. Well no this is my point, you are not hearing my point, and the louder the more um vemom(ph) they get about the point they are trying to make, the less able they are to hear the other persons point, where they are coming from.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, it's fun, because there was actually two texts, there was a lot of caps, and a lot of exclamation points.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, wasn't even in person?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, wow. Really.\nUNKNOWN: He was still texting me, and you could tell when a person is yelling because they're typing in all caps, or lot of exclamations and just like that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Hmmm.\nUNKNOWN: So he wasn't able to hear the sincerity in my voice, and I wasn't able to hear in his either.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. I know somebody who doesn't text you, says texting is good well he says it about email too. It's good at sending messages, but not communicating.\nUNKNOWN: That's true.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Because you'll lose all that.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. The text can easily be misunderstood as well.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Hmmm, yeah. Is that what happened with him. Did he misunderstand your text?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh.\nUNKNOWN: It was just a full of argument over the texts, so I mean I'm pretty clear, I'm pretty clear at typing how I speak so yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You didn't like something he wrote.\nUNKNOWN: No just the whole situation period, we were just going back and forth, it's just like what we each should have been saying to each other, it was just put in a message.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So wasn't so much of misunderstanding as really a disagreement.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: About something. He thinks this and you think this, and you are not going to change each other's mind.\nUNKNOWN: Right. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Do you have relationships with people where -- I'm guessing you do, but you know relationships with people that you disagree on some, something.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's something really important.\nUNKNOWN: If there is something really important, it's most likely like a family member that who may disagree on you. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I think a family is, particularly like thanksgiving dinner. It's like, preparation for being in the work world because you have all these people in your family who are really diverse, different political persuasions, and sometimes different religions, sometimes different cultures, and you are all going to sit down, have a peaceful dinner together right. Yeah, with this kind of preparation for being out in the work world, that you don't have to be best friends with everybody you work with, but you have to get along.\nUNKNOWN: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And figure out a way to get along.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, I had a disagreement with my brother this weekend, and maybe I used -- he did not understand what I was trying to say. Like I said, he has a baby, the baby will be six months, and this is my brothers first, I have two. I've worked with infants, so I'm just like this is what I know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know a lot.\nUNKNOWN: Right. So I just mentioned to him, I asked him about the baby's bottles, and he said, I don't know. And I'm like, well, just show -- I asked him about the nipples on the bottle, I'm like well, take it apart, and show me the nipple, because it's possible that the baby needs a bigger, you know sized nipple.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Hmm.\nUNKNOWN: Well, I'm not raising my child, the way that you raised yours. And I'm like where did that come from like, I'm talking about the nipple on a bottle, and that's it. It's not about how you raise your child, I'm like, I'm trying to teach you. I don't need you to teach me anything, and I'm like okay, so I'm like watch this, I pulled the nipple out, and it was a new born nipple, I'm like he is going to be six month, I'm like you need to change the nipples every three months. And he -- what else do you have to say? I'm like, okay, well since you asked, you asked, I said, well, you don't put Orajel on a baby's gums, and then feed them, because Orajel numbs the tongue as well, and they can choke. And he didn't say anything else back until he was listening. I can tell, I'm -- and I said him, I'm not going to tell you anything wrong especially when it comes to something I know very well. And babies I know very well. I know how to care for them, and this is also my nephew, you know, I'm like I'll never tell you anything wrong. But he was upset for that moment, I was just like calm down, it's not even that serious.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So his reaction was defensive.\nUNKNOWN: Yes, because he --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's a good example.\nUNKNOWN: I think because I used the word, let me teach you something, it was more like you know, I know what I'm doing. And I'm just like, well really you don't because this is your first, you've never had interactions with an infant, so you don't know what you're doing, but it's okay to let somebody show you, or let somebody just to tell you -- I'm not trying to tell you what to do, I'm just trying to inform you basically. And I thought him I'm like if you don't believe me, look it up googling. You'll see I'm like just as we should change our tooth brushes, a baby, unlike your baby is going to be six months, why does he still have a new born nipple. It doesn't make sense. But I'm just like, I then raised my voice, I actually kind of laughed about, because I'm like, you are upset about something at surface, I didn't try to go no deeper than the surface, I'm like let's keep it on surface level.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, that's very insightful what you just said about, maybe if I hadn't said, let me teach you something. Because that sounds like the kind of a lead in that could raise his defensiveness, but it sounds like you handled it well afterwards, and then he did too, he kind of calmed down.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Well the reason I was asking you, if you have any close relationships with anybody that you have, you disagree on things, but you still have the relationship is because you know you do like -- and even with your brother you know you have -- there are some things you see differently than he sees and yet you maintain those relationship. So somehow you are able to keep the connection with the person, and kind of set aside that difference, whatever that difference of opinion is or is that different view or something.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You can -- can you say that you do that?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, my favorite cousin who lives in Illinois who I also consider my best friend, she is a lesbian, and I may not agree with her lifestyle, but it's not for me to be judgmental or to really speak on it. I treat her no differently than I treat anyone else. But just that one part of her life I don't agree with, but I just feel that if she is happy, I have no choice but to be happy with her or for her. So yeah, I've never like openly disagree with her, but she know my religious background, and she has heard my views on it way before I even found out that she was a lesbian. But she still feels comfortable enough to share with me, and I still listen because that's my cousin, she is my best friend, and part of being nonjudgmental is you listen without judgment, so yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So I'm wondering about this, the friend this weekend, is he somebody that you could see maintaining a friendship with or a connection too even though you -- even if you never come to resolving this particular issue you know.\nUNKNOWN: I know that the issue, it was just a matter of respect and that is a huge thing with me, just being respectful because I respect anyone I come across even if I disagree or even if I dislike you, I'm still going to respect you because it doesn't make sense not to. So I know it will be resolved, and he is definitely a friend who I want to keep for a long time, you know, it's just about being able to respect one another. And my thing was I cannot respect you and have -- I cannot be your friend and have you disrespectful to me. So until you can learn to respect me as I respect you, we just may not need to talk for a while. Yeah, but I -- it's definitely going to -- it's definitely going to be resolved and it will definitely be a friendship that keeps going.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, and then I think it's good too that you recognized that just like you respect other people, you expect to be respected too, this isn't about becoming a doormat.\nUNKNOWN: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And saying okay, however you want to treat me, that's fine, because I want the relationship, it's more -- giving him time to cool off, and then you will continue to treat him respectfully, and hopefully, he will come around and see how he needs to treat you or...\nUNKNOWN: And he did mention that he was like I'll be more mindful of you, I mean, of your feelings, and I'm just like, the whole disagreement should have never happened -- that's all you had to say was I'll be more mindful, and all of the drama would have never even happened. You know, that was just my point to try to give him the seats, just be more mindful of how I feel.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: You know I respect your feelings, I respect your wishes, you know so I just do the same for me. So he got it, it's a whole mess to get it, but I'm just like, you got it, but you -- you know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that wasn't the end point, there was a conversation that just kept going and then --\nUNKNOWN: No because he still felt the needs so just I saw that he got it, and I'm just like okay, well you know just okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Hmmm. Well we've got just a few minutes left. Do you see a next step for yourself kind of staying on that wellness path or and it might be with regard to the self-care. You know there is one thing I want to say about the self-care too there, in addition to thinking of it broadly like the physical, emotional and spiritual, to also think of it, is it -- it can be like the action piece behavior changing something in your environment, but it can also be internal too like thinking more compassionately about yourself, or caring more for yourself, or saying kind things to yourself, or you know not beating yourself up that kind of thing too. Or like a common sort of belief the automatic thought people often hold on to that prevents them from doing self-care is the thought, oh that's selfish, I'm being so selfish if I do that, you know when it's really just about taking care of yourself, so then you can take care of other people too.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: The people we care about.\nUNKNOWN: And I am really hard on myself, I don't give myself enough credit, and I've been told that many times, but I just don't see it like, maybe my husband says it all the time, and maybe I just don't see it as he sees it. So one part of self-care is the kind of losing up of myself, and one thing that I'm going to do, I was looking on life or like just like an overnight stay, like a hotel, and like a massage, just to try to -- just treat myself to something more relaxing, because I do deserve those things. And just, yeah just have a soothing day for myself, because I -- you know graduation is almost here, I start my last class tomorrow. So that's exciting and kind of stressful at the same time, because it's just like okay one more -- you know the last one I got to make home, really I haven't mentioned, but I've been really beating myself up because I haven't been able to make dean's list which is really one of my goals when I'm always just like two or three points shy, I'm just like okay what can I do to push myself, and it's just I was -- just like sometimes I feel like I give up, like okay I'm just going to do this. And just as far as homework is I'm just going to -- okay, he ask for eight pages, I'm going to give him eight pages in the essay nothing, you know more. But I think that the -- that more can push me and can push my points higher to get on dean's list, but I'm just like okay, I'm down in my last class, it's not going to happen this quarter, but maybe next quarter I can go ahead and do it. So I have to know that I'm doing great, I am, but I still do need to push myself and orders to reach the goal that I want, I have to push myself a little harder, and it is not like beat up on myself, but it's okay, this is your goal, you know what it takes to do it, let's get it done.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, and I know, that's not beating yourself up, that's just sort of self-motivating talk right.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, but I have been beating myself up as far as you know you didn't make it this time. This is your what, second or third time going forward, and you haven't made it yet. You know, so I tried to keep those negative thoughts aside, because I still have some time to go. So even though it didn't happen this time, it can happen going forward.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know, I found it's a lot harder to stop, make yourself stop saying negative things, than it is to start saying positive things, because when you start saying positive things, you basically change your focus, you know from the negative to the positive, and there is no room for the negative. If you are saying something positive, there is no room for the negative. So is there something positive you could replace that with when you hear those thoughts start to come up in you that, well, this is the third of fourth time, you've -- you haven't gotten there you know, why bother you, what's the positive thing you could say to yourself.\nUNKNOWN: Still got more time.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And that's very true, you do. How about even more positive kind of encouraging.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

I got a cold Monday night. So, I didn't want to be, you know, sick around the children. So, I just stayed home.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Did you get some rest?\nMARY: Kind of.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Were your kids -- were your kids at school, right?\nMARY: No -- yeah, they were at school. So, I was kind of able to get some rest, kind of home working, what not. Got a lot of quiet time, you know, with the kids being gone. So, I had a lot of quiet time.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How was that for you?\nMARY: Relaxing.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Good. You don't have any trouble being alone then, huh?\nMARY: Oh, no.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No.\nMARY: Sometimes I prefer it. At times when I just need some quiet time, I like to be alone.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did you do the homework?\nMARY: Honestly, forgot what it was. But I had no idea like a lot of -- some of the exercises that we talked about.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, did you continue the focusing exercise?\nMARY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good. Okay.\nMARY: Yeah, I did do that because I forgot initially what we talked about, and you told me if I didn't write it down, what I was thinking then, I'll probably forget.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, you know what, it was the vaguest that we've had so far. Before, this has always have been something very specific and this was sort of more general to just kind of watch out for the self-talk that was I think I put sort of self-talk that would keep you from doing self-care, that would be good self-care like thinking to yourself, oh, that's selfish, like you know, I don't need that or I really shouldn't focus so much on myself for anything like that.\nMARY: Okay. When I did do the positive, I didn't do the self-care, but I did do the positive because Monday night I had a paper do and when I looked at all the requirements for the paper, I had confusion about it. So, of course, that confusion just set me on a spiral like okay, you can't do this, you don't know how to do this. It's like I had to make a chart, excuse me, and I am looking, I'm like I don't know how to create this chart. You know, the papers do, what am I going to do. So, I thought okay, I can't do it. So, I emailed my instructor and just asked for an extension. And he granted me it and then my husband was there, and he looked at it and he was like, well, why don't you ask him if he could just break down the chart so you won't have to create actually chart, just break it down, and you know, the components that the chart has. And I'm like duh why didn't I think of that, so I am like, okay, I can do that. And so, I emailed the instructor, asked if it was okay, and he was like, yeah, that's really a better way. So, I'm like, okay, and I got it done.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh.\nMARY: But as first it was, I saw it, I didn't understand it. I started to like freak out a little bit, like, oh, I am not going to know how to do this. It's going to be bad paper. What I really knew how to do is just I had to change the set up of it. So, I had to break it down for myself. But as far as those negative thoughts of you can't do it came in, and so I had a positive factor saying, you know what, try another way. So I went on and got it done.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, you did that in a real deliberate way too. You look like you very consciously noticed the negative thoughts and then you said to yourself, okay, wait a minute, try to be more positive, let's look for a way out of this. Yeah? Oh, good for you. That's great.\nMARY: I know I need to start a way into like the day off to do the homework. But it's kind of like a habit, but you know I thought like, okay, here you go again, day off, now you don't really comprehend, but I was still able to block that out and find another way to get it done.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did you notice at all, did you do that focusing thing as part of this, I mean you didn't have to, but sometimes that's the -- where people when they start to escalate, they notice the body part like for you it's your head, right, when you get tense, did you happen to notice, was your head or the cue.\nMARY: Not it all. My husband was there. And we had -- actually it was my son's birthday, Monday. So, he came over and we were actually just like sitting around talking, we were talking about the sessions and what not, and I heard him like in the midst of me getting ready to spiral down, I heard him say, I didn't even realize he was standing next to me, he was looking at the computer and he said, well, why don't you break down the chart. So, it's like I still heard him say that and I thought, okay, yeah, you know that I can do. But I didn't even really feel like anxious or anything. It was just like a thought, but like I didn't feel my heartbeat raise, started to rise or nothing. It was just a brief thought like, oh, I can't do this.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, well, when we did that exercise before, we did on your head, didn't we, like you get tense, kind of like a headache, yes, that's why I said your head then, yeah, okay. Well, yeah, and if you don't -- if you get to the positive self-talk place first, that's fine. Sometimes people have a hard time getting there and in their body gives them cues about it. So, I can help that way, but, well, good for you, that's great. Would you -- do you think you would have done that say maybe three months ago?\nMARY: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No.\nMARY: I was passed out.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, yeah. Okay.\nMARY: Because like, just because it's crunch time like I like the rush when I know what I am doing, but when I don't know what I'm doing, I'm like okay, I have to take a step back and you know, really think about it where usually I'm just like rushing and go ahead and get it done. So, three months ago, no, I really would have just started to panic and it would not, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, this really a skill now that you've learned. I mean you've got this down this thing of paying attention to what you're saying to yourself and how that can affect your feelings.\nMARY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And in turn probably behavior too, then that do you things that are self-defeating or --.\nMARY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, good.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, do you see a next step?\nMARY: Not really a next time because I fully haven't gotten down the self-care yet. I want to really like focus on one --where everything going on, I want to focus on one thing at a time. So, I was still really like shall I do the self-care.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, yeah. Do you find yourself being more aware of it like asking yourself what do I need right now or?\nMARY: Yeah, ever since we've talked about that, yeah. I may not notice every time, but I am more aware of it now that you've told me like what it is and you know, pretty much how it kinda goes. I notice it a bit more now, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Are you seeing a link between that, well, your stress level and that you're listening?\nMARY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You are, okay. Have you had an example where you were more able to hear somebody because you weren't stressed out?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Good.\nMARY: She telling me everything because sometimes in my family they don't tell it all because they don't want you to worry. But she was telling me all. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, you aren't so stressed, so you could really pay attention to what she was saying. And you listened and heard her, was the focusing exercise a part of that, like did you kinda in the moment you noticed, well, was there a moment where you noticed like you're about to escalate, but then kinda went inside yourself on, okay.\nMARY: Yeah, because the first thing I will say was, why didn't you call me. When she told me ER, I didn't hear anything else, I was like, why didn't you call me, all you have to do is call me, I would have met you there, I would have come home, you know, whenever your needed, I would have, and then I just stopped, because she kinda like pause me, and she calls me Meemo, so she was like Meemo, and I'm just like okay. I took a moment, I'm like let me hear her before I just jump defensive and you know, treat her like the daughter, like why don't you call me and I took a moment. It was brief, but I still took it to hear her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Good. Yeah and that you just stated the word defensive too. So, that's really good too, that it can really help you especially in those moments when somebody said something that would make you defensive or they are getting defensive, you know, because those are the harder times to listen. Good. I am thinking to go in two different directions here, now do you have a direction you want to go today, something you want to focus on?\nMARY: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No, okay. Well, the one direction is to ask you about other situations where this maybe a challenge to kinda go down that road to think ahead about how you could use this more effectively, this sort of slowdown, take deep breath, focusing word, disconnect a little, you know, step back a bit so you don't get drawn into something defensive or escalating, that's one road. And then the other road was to ask you if you -- you had mentioned before that you are really hard on yourself at one point, I think and I was wondering if that extends to kinda your self-talk or internal dialog like if you really focus on your weaknesses, you know, the way we all have weaknesses but you tend to -- do you tend to be somebody who just be rate yourself, beat yourself up and bottom, and doesn't really see your strength or that kind of thing.\nMARY: At times, sometimes I am not the first one I notice it and maybe like someone closer to me who notices it or maybe I notice it, I just try to hide it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Which? The weakness or the strength?\nMARY: Yes, the weakness.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nMARY: Yeah, because no one wants to see your weaknesses pointed out. So, sometimes I will like, like if someone is telling me like I'm spoiled. I am really spoiled. I had a friend tell me today you like it no way, you know, your way or no way and like things I may say to others can't be said to me, which is true at times, but I think that's all a part of my listening and yeah, part of my listening, I think, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That you can say something snippier somebody, but they better not say it to you, is that what you meant?\nMARY: It depends; not all the time snippy. I can't think of a situation, oh, this morning I told a friend I'll call you right back. And I can here like to they had to say because we were in a good conversation, but I had to go and do some business. So I'm like, I'll call you right back. And it was, uh, and I was like --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Like the husband and --\nMARY: No, this is just a friend.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, a friend.\nMARY: I don't like, well, what did you do that for? He was like because if you are in part of a good conversation and I tell you I'll call you right back, you will get upset, and you will say the same thing. And I'm like, yeah, I would. I'm like but if you're handling business, I wouldn't. He was like, well, you can't decide which is more important, you know, like because this is important to you, it should be important to me. Kind of how he was just basically saying respect the conversation kind of, if I'm respectful to you and your moments that you need to talk, you need to be the same way. But I was still like, okay, I have to handle business. I am going into a place of business, I don't need to be on my phone.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: All right.\nMARY: I will literally call you right back. So, I just think that was one moment.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So, you do -- I'm not sure I know if you're -- if you do beat yourself up a lot or it's like you're hard on yourself?\nMARY: I do.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What kinds of things -- so that's the road to go down, remember I was telling you like two ways I could see go in right now.\nMARY: We can actually go both but since you're talking about beating myself up, yeah, I do really when it comes to my skill, like I have a lot of friends who are multi-talented in a lot of areas. And I really don't see ways that I am, but instead of trying something, I automatically you know put myself against like I can't do it. Like I was -- I tell a lot of people I am only teacher, you know, who is not crafty like I don't know how to do crafts and all that, but honestly I don't really try to do them. But another situation --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And that's definitely a put-down, it's like a label you stamp on yourself and when you put a label on yourself like that, it sticks, doesn't it? Yeah?\nMARY: Yeah. And like with school, like I say going for the dance list, I've always you know the minute I don't see my name on the list, here you see again, you failed at it again, you didn't you know stretch again. Although I told you last time I maybe only by like three or four points. And so, now I'm working on, pushing myself like you know to push those negative thoughts out and more positive, like maybe you didn't get it this time, but next time you know shoot a little harder.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Have you ever made a list of everything you've going for you?\nMARY: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No? That's where I am going with this. I -- if you had told me that you know I have great self-esteem and I don't thing you know -- I see my weaknesses, but I focus on my strengths, I would say, okay, well, we're going down the other road. But since you're telling me this, I'll explain this layers with people, it's called the personal strength inventory. And basically we make a list of all the things you have going for you and that includes things like your personal qualities, internal qualities, things you do well, your accomplishments, things you're proud of, any sort of religious or cultural strengths or support -- even supports that you have in the form of people or faith or beliefs or whatever, anything at all that works for you like it's a strength or support in your life. And I am going to write it down. I am going to start -- I will start it by asking you what you think of and then because I can see lots. But I like to start it with you trying to think of it because it forces you to look for that you know, then I will add them if you have hard time.\nMARY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So, why don't you just start out with whatever you can think of?\nMARY: My education. I have two degrees and working on a third.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Really?\nMARY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, I didn't realize that, wow.\nMARY: My years of experience.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, I'm going to write these like in the form of a statement. This is going to be something you're saying about yourself. So, I have two degrees and I am working on the third. Okay. And then, sorry, what was the next one?\nMARY: I have years of experience in teaching.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Have years of teaching experience.\nMARY: I'm going to say I can be a good communicator.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You have the skills to do that. Yeah.\nMARY: I have the skill to be a good communicator. I have a high level of professionalism.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

And I'm a great friend.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, wait a minute, I can't write that fast. Okay, I'm a great mother, okay. Then, did you say I'm a great friend?\nMARY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nMARY: I'm highly motivated.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nMARY: I'm open to learning.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you like to learn?\nMARY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you love to learn?\nMARY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I figured you did, yeah. And I think that's a huge strength too, yeah.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nMARY: I have a good support system.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nMARY: Had a stuck after that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You're kinda stuck?\nMARY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. So how about any like cultural or religious kinds of supports or strength?\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nMARY: I'm increasing my prayer life.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Just the fact that you have a prayer life too, you know. And I think of religion too is a source of strength and support in a couple of ways, one is, in terms for many people it's the faith, kind of internal faith. And then it can also be in the form of people, you know, the Church and people around you that support you. Do you have one or both, or?\nMARY: I'm not since I haven't been going -- really been going over the last couple of months. So, I haven't really built that part back in. So, not at the moment, but I'm sure once I get back into the habit of faithfully -- going faithfully, then yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, and the thing is you have had it in the past, right?\nMARY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, I even consider that as source of strength and support that you, you know how to do that and you've done it in the past so that you can do it again.\nMARY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know, so, okay, I am going to put that. I've had a - how would you put that like good church support in the past or good -\nMARY: Yeah.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And then what about the faith part of it?\nMARY: I used to have a strong sense of faith, I can't say how you put it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. I have strong sense of faith, you said? And what would your mother say is your strength, the best thing about you, this thing she loves about you?\nMARY: Talking.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That you are a good talker?\nMARY: You are a good communicator, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And I am going to put that in addition to your point about, I can be a good communicator because it's another source of strength to know that your mother believes in you as a communicator, right? My mom thinks I am a good communicator too. That's a source of support. How about your dad?\nMARY: My dad is me period, he is for me whatever, he is for me, but we both talk a lot. So, he thinks that I can be a speaker. So, he like encourages me to do programs at the church or like leadership programs at work.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, my dad encourages me and he believes in me.\nMARY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Believes I can do anything?\nMARY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's great.\nMARY: Sometimes when I don't believe me, he does.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, that's a great thing to have somebody like that in your life. Is that your bio dad or your step-dad?\nMARY: My step.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Step-dad, okay, and would your bio dad say anything ?\nMARY: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No? Okay. How about your husband? What he'd say he loves about you?\nMARY: That I am a supporter, very supportive.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, my husband says I am very supportive. And what would your kids say?\nMARY: And there was, mom, you rock, that's them.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, good, I am going to write that.\nMARY: My kids say mom, you rock. How about your favorite teacher at school?\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nMARY: My favorite teacher at school would tell me that I am a great learner because I seek out answers and I seek to understand. Another one thing I am thinking about now my co-workers - my co-workers, since I have the most experience in the field, they look to me for, I guess I can say guidance, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, my co-workers look to me for guidance. Wow, so they see you as a leader?\nMARY: Yeah.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you have a supervisor?\nMARY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What would your supervisor say?\nMARY: She would say that - because we just talked, she would say that I have the potential to be one of the lead there at school -- at the Center.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, my supervisor says I have the potential to be the leader?\nMARY: Yeah, if I could lead teaching position.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, you got 19, we got to do just one more and make it even 20.\nMARY: Well from my favorite cousin and also my sister said, you can go half and half because I value both of them. Both of them would say that I am their encourager because both of them choose to go back to school, I can't see post on Facebook like my grades and how school is going, so both of them decided to go back to school to pursue theirs.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, you are their encourager and you've inspired them, huh?\nMARY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So, I hope you can read my writing. Let me show you this and have you read it. Could you read it aloud? And see if you can kinda let it sink in while you are reading it too, you know, and also be sure you can read my writing.\nMARY: Okay. So, my strengths: I have two degrees and I am working on the third. I have years of teaching experience. I can be a good communicator. I have a high level of professionalism. I am a great mother. I am a great friend. I am highly motivated. I am open to learn it and I love to learn. I have a good support system. I am increasing my prayer life. I've had good church support in the past. I have a strong sense of faith. My mom thinks I am a good communicator. My dad encourages and believes I can do anything. My husband says I am very supportive. My kids say, \"mom, you rock\". My favorite teacher thinks I am a great learner and I seek to understand. My co-workers look to me for guidance. My supervisor says I have the potential to lead, to be the lead teacher. My cousin and sister say that I am their encourager and have inspired them. Well, 20 things, and I am sure there is more, but they are off top, this sounds like me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's, you know, just like in 5 minutes we came up with that. Yeah, how do you feel when you read those?\nMARY: I feel like I slaked myself a lot when I don't have to, like if I didn't focus on the negative, I would be able to fill up three or four of these pages. So, I just know like looking at the 20, I just know that I can continue to push myself towards the positive and not focus so much on the negative of things that I think I don't do, which may not always be the case.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: When you see this too, this very positive focus, do you - can you see how you've probably been skewed towards the negative about yourself, because these things weren't really in your forefront of your thought?\nMARY: Yeah. Like I would say the top three or four are like always at the forefront of my mind because it's something I am always working on, you know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: The communicator and listener, and?\nMARY: The communicator, my years of experience, my level of professionalism and the fact that I am working on completing a third degree.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, so that you stay pretty aware of?\nMARY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay.\nMARY: Because this something like I say something else. I mean, of course being a mother, a great mother every day, but who says I am a great mother besides my kids. You know, of course they think I am the best, which I know I am the best for them, I am.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, I would say your kids' votes count.\nMARY: Oh yeah, definitely.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. And I am guessing your husband would probably say the same thing, wouldn't he?\nMARY: Yeah, yes, they will, all of them.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Those seem like the most important votes?\nMARY: Yeah, they are.\n[sil.]\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: So, that was the road, I went this road, yeah?\nMARY: I have a cork board in my room, I am going to hang it right on my cork board, that's where I put all my important papers.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good, okay. Good. And you can add to it.\nMARY: Yeah, and I will.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So then the other thing that we were talking about, the other road, do you remember what that was?\nMARY: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I don't either.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Just lost it. Might have been something related to the like being a better listener and connecting that. Oh, I know what it was. Thinking ahead about other areas in which this ability that you've now acquired, this skill to kinda take a deep breath, focus on yourself in the moment and kinda pull yourself out of the emotional reactivity to a situation that might like a great defensiveness, you know, that you know the skill now, can you see ahead and see situations in which it's likely that you might have to use it, just kinda think ahead about that?\nMARY: Yeah, at work. It's kinda stressful because we need more teachers and we need more coverage period in our building and sometimes my co-workers they'll get kinda like - they'll get upset because it's not good communication even from this side of the hall to that side of the hall, it is not like really good communication with the other teachers. It's really like this side communicates and this side communicates when we all should be communicating. So, I try till I have a mobile, we have company email. So, I try to send everyone the same email like, you know, just like encouragement or like on Fridays I have feel good Fridays where we will bring in treats and stuff for everyone. But definitely I have those moments where I know I need to step back because I could easily get sucked into like feeding to the negativity because it's happened before and I just like yelled at like three of my co-workers. I told them, you guys -- they were all complaining and I had them hearing enough of it and I just told them, like you guys are wearing me out. I said you do not realize how much you are complaining until you sit back and listen to yourself. And they were like, I don't know like mouths open like I can't believe, you know, Mary just yelled at us. But I didn't like mean to yell, but it boiled up. It boiled up so they - you know, I apologized, you know, I didn't mean to yell and one of the teachers came back to me the next day and she was like, you know, well, you are right. She was like I do notice that we all complain a lot, but we don't put forth the effort to change what we are complaining about. So, maybe that was that day, you know, and for a while it kinda worked, but I know - we work with children. You know, we work - children are parents' most precious gift. So, a lot of times we have issues with parents as well. So, we just have to learn how to balance. So, it's going to take for me since I am a leader in the classroom, it's going to take for me to have my step-back moments, so I won't cause negativity as well by speaking something negative. And we actually have a jar that we started for lent, where every time we have a negative thought or say a negative thought, we put a quarter in the jar.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Wow.\nMARY: And I said I was going to count the money because we have dollars in there now. And I am just like we have bills, so I am just like, okay, are we really doing this much. So, you know, we thought it was just like funny, but really I am going to have look at the jar on Friday and say, because lent will be ending soon, like this how many negative thoughts we have, that we have this much money in this small jar.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know, as a first step that makes sense to kind of call your attention to -- your awareness of the negativity but a way to get that more focused on the positive might be that every time somebody says a positive thing, they get to take a quarter out.\nMARY: Yeah, that will work.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then they start counting, counting it and doing more of it, you know.\nMARY: I know for myself, I put 2.75 in. I keep count of myself. And really it was just like, okay, that helps me because I am just like, you have $2.75 worth of negative thoughts or negative comments. And then it's just like if you are going for a leader position, you have to check yourself on that. But I won't always catch it, but I need to be more mindful because if they are going to call me their lead teacher and they are going to need to come to me for support or for advice, I am going to have to make sure I am in a mind frame to give it to them and not -- you know, focus on the positive of the situation and not feeding to the negativity.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, I think that's really good that you are paying attention to that and noticing it. I may have mentioned to you before this idea of it's a lot easier to increase a positive behavior than it is to stop a negative behavior because when you are focusing, when you have to stop a negative behavior, you have to focus on -- you have to pay attention to it, you know, and you want to actually increase your attention to positives. It's sort of like the analogy of I read about was if I say to you, think of a purple elephant right now, just kind of imagine a purple elephant here, about this size and right in front of you, a purple trunk and everything, you know. And so, now I am going to ask you, as we continue to talk, stop thinking about that purple elephant, okay? I don't want you to think about the purple elephant, just keep the purple elephant out of your mind, okay? It's right there.\nMARY: I still see a purple elephant.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right, exactly. But now could you imagine a giraffe that's pink with yellow spots and it's about six-and-a-half feet tall, maybe that's a baby giraffe, and it has a green tail.\nMARY: Interesting.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did you stop thinking about the purple elephant?\nMARY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, because you replaced it with the giraffe. So, it's easier if you focus on something else, you know, and particularly if it's positive, that's a nice feeling. So, yeah, you might think of a way to reward yourself and your co-workers like come up with a way for, you might be a bit for much for everybody to take a quarter or might be a penny for a thought.\nMARY: It's really five of us doing it. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It's kind of like with kids, you know, recently somebody told me they would come up with a chore chart for their kids and they did it by - they gave their kids five bucks at the beginning of the week and then every time they did something wrong, they took away $0.50. You know, it's like a whole -- like punishing kinda focus on the negative, just flip it around and give him nothing at the beginning of the week and give him a quarter every time they do the chore, if they do the day's chores, you know, give them $0.50 or something, like that idea, which you probably do something like that with kids like reinforcement of things.\nMARY: Yeah, with my children, their chores, I don't necessarily reward their chores or really their good behavior. I always keep it in my mind that they've done it, but I don't just automatically reward it. I wait until I see if it's continuous and then I reward. But I don't tell them, well, this was for, you are doing this because they will think, oh, well, let me keep doing it, I'll get more of this.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, just for the money. But you do the idea of positive enforcement.\nMARY: Yeah, definitely.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Your kids are small enough too, it's nice they are at the age where they light up with positive and just verbal reinforcement.\nMARY: Yeah, high five is the word for it. With my daughter some piece of chocolate will work for her.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

I kept in my purse actually.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, good, good, and how was that for you to do that to read it.\nUNKNOWN: It was what can I say, not intriguing, inspiring.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: Good.\nUNKNOWN: Just to think, you know, always thinks about me even though he is just 20, 20 is still a lot. I mean, like I say he could go more, but just to read those ones that I didn't even think about.\nPAMELA HAYS: That are just, they just pop right in.\nUNKNOWN: Right.\nPAMELA HAYS: Easily, yeah. I like the word inspire.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: I looked it up and it means to breathe life into.\nUNKNOWN: Okay.\nPAMELA HAYS: Kind of like respiration, but I think we all need inspiration.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: We need, sometimes we need it when we're really low and then I think we need it on an ongoing basis just to keep ourselves inspired and it's nice when other things and other people inspire us. But I think it's also good to have this way of inspiring yourself too. Yeah. Are there other ways that you get inspired?\nUNKNOWN: Some things come from others or like things that I may see or read.\nPAMELA HAYS: Sort of happenstance or you mean, can you do you think about inspiring yourself?\nUNKNOWN: Not isn't nothing as like really jumping off at me. Yeah, nothing I could just think of off-hand on how to inspire myself.\nPAMELA HAYS: Some people will like listen to tapes, particular CDs or something on the - in their car on the way on the drive to work something inspiring. Or some people like read something every morning that's inspiring to them.\nUNKNOWN: Oh, every day at 1:37, I don't know why that time, but every day at 1:37 I have the Holy Bible app on my phone and it sends I'm doing the 1 year Bible. So, every day it sends like a scripture along well like a passage of how to explain the scripture. So, every day I read that. And sometimes, yes they really it hits me dead on and sometimes it's just like okay something to think about.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. And so I post on my Facebook too.\nPAMELA HAYS: That's a great idea, that's just what I'm talking about. Yeah. Do you feel like you have enough inspiration in your life right now? Or do you need more?\nUNKNOWN: I noticed that once I opened up like he told me you start borrowing things then once I open to talk to people. I can say I have enough now it's just those who I talk to.\nPAMELA HAYS: So you mean just in the last couple of weeks you have been doing that more?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, wow.\nUNKNOWN: I have been trying to.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, can you give me an example?\nUNKNOWN: Well, when I cried to my friend the other day, Monday when I just called her and just let her know just exactly how I feel yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: That was after the argument with the other friend? Yeah. Oh good. I didn't remember that you told me that. I remember you said you went in a room and cried when you were at work?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, I called her to talk to her. She is older than me. I'm 29 she is she is 44. So she has years on me and she listen first. And sometimes people just that will be all right, don't worry about it. But she listened and she is like well, if you just need to cry, just go ahead and cry. So that was helpful just like get it out. Yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: I think you do need to vent sometimes when those things, those hurtful things happen and then when you get it out, you can then start to think about okay, how could I make this situation better or if I can't, how can I feel better, how can I think about it differently, so I'm not hurting so much. Well, I know this is the last time we are meeting and have you been thinking about that at all?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, is there anything that you want to focus on today?\nUNKNOWN: You are not leaving. But personally for myself, it's been a good, even though it's only been six sessions, it's been good, it's been enlightening just to like look into to myself and to hear it from other people and you helped me to like focus my attention on certain things and you've given me words that I wouldn't even know how to like to apply and what not. So, it's really like moving forward, just to keep, keep on that positive path.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, good. Good. Well, thanks I'm glad that this has been helpful. What are the things like, there might be strategies or techniques or even just things you've learned that you sort of stand out to you that you want to hold on to.\nUNKNOWN: Listening. Just to breakdown that defensive wall when I hear something just not so, just get defensive about it. And today, my daily prayer for my Bible was about criticism. Like the wise accept criticism, but only a fool will like blast it kind of, I can't right really quote it. But it was just basically saying that is okay to take criticism even if it's like not the criticism you expect. So I mean, in the job that I work, the family that I have criticism is coming and I just know that I need to not just automatically have the notion that it's going to be bad or it's going to be something to upset me. But if I just listen to what they are saying and actually hear what they are saying it may just be something that helps me.\nPAMELA HAYS: This would be the family of a child that you work with?\nUNKNOWN: It could be my boss, my co-workers, maybe even parents or even my own family just, just listen period, just you know.\nPAMELA HAYS: When I first started writing research articles years ago, I think people have got nicer about editorial critics now, but back then, they would be real, they would be really nasty sometimes, like how could you possibly think this. And so what I would do to keep myself from getting defensive about it, would why I still feel defensive really. But what I do to help me with it was I would read what they had just written and then I would take it over here and then in my own words put it on paper, a separate piece of paper because I had to respond to each of these. And then I would respond to my words, the way I had put it, because I wouldn't put it in words that were mean or put me down. And it sounds kind of like that or wondering if that's kind of what you do when you get criticism from somebody that you try to listen for the like the message, the content in there, the useful content and ignore the effect part, the emotional part if they happened to be snotty about it or something.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Have you had any situations, where the person really was trying to be mean like they were really putting you down?\nUNKNOWN: No.\nPAMELA HAYS: No, oh, okay.\nUNKNOWN: I have like, my personality gets along with a lot of people and I'm not a mean person. So, like I don't attract mean people to me. So I cannot think of any recent instances, where I had someone being just mean to me at all.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, good. Okay. I mean, I think even with those situations, a most generous interpretation of that which I use often is just that when someone does something hurtful to you even if they are intentionally trying to hurt you, it's often coming out of fear like if your husband would say something really hurtful to you on purpose because he wants to hurt you that it's probably because he is feeling hurt himself or afraid that you are pulling away or something like that.\nUNKNOWN: Okay. Now you just said, do you have instance with that. Yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, spouses are good for that.\nUNKNOWN: Right, we never really argue. We've been together for 11 years and I can say we only probably had like four arguments. And one time we got into argument, I was in school then he called me a dummy and he called me stupid and that really pissed me off. And I'm just like and I told her once that I don't mind a dump one and I'm surpassing you and your education and that's what it was. He stopped at a certain level with his education and now he saw me at the time going and going and going and doing good at it. So it was like his defense mechanism, of course he apologized for that would not. And but just the thing that he said those things because in a sense he felt inadequate about himself. So it was kind of understandable, it was easily forgiving.\nPAMELA HAYS: So his was probably coming out of fear to like, oh my gosh if she is going to get so educated, she is going to want to be with me anymore or something like that?\nUNKNOWN: No, I don't think it was that. He comes from a family who they pride themselves on their education and sometimes they do belittle people whose education is lower than theirs, so for meets or surpass in their mind it was like okay, I can use that.\nPAMELA HAYS: Why would he be a little use and if you are surpassed his?\nUNKNOWN: Because I'm surpassing him. Like I said, he stopped at a certain level and I'm still going.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. So he was kind of trying to pull you down to where he was feeling lower.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, okay so the hurt kind of thing. Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: It didn't work.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah that was all a while back right, not recently?\nUNKNOWN: Probably, two, maybe two to three years ago.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, okay.\nUNKNOWN: So still recent enough.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. But then you were able to do that to not respond defensively.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. I'm going to have not to react.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. So the focusing exercise kind of helps with that for you?\nUNKNOWN: Yea, I took a moment today to focus. We were coming in from outside and I have two babies, one is mobile, one is non-mobile and they both were crying, both of them were sleepy, but I can't do it by myself like, so I was just like what I'm going to do I couldn't find one pacifier and I had to make a bottle for the other oh my god all I hear is crying. So I kind of like, I just don't have for a moment and I sat on the floor and I laid the Mobo like his head on my lap, he was fine and while fit, the other one and they stopped, and I was just like yes. They were quite. I was able to calm them down. I didn't get upset. I didn't get frustrated because they were crying because they are babies and\nPAMELA HAYS: Did you come to that decision to do that because you have just done the focusing thing kind of taking a deep breath inside yourself.\nUNKNOWN: Yes because like I said I was looking for one pacifier and I could not find it anywhere in my class room, so I sat on the floor. I said maybe if I sit at their level, maybe I'll see it, you know 'cause you're standing and looking at, so I see it let me sit down. And when I sat down, he came over and he laid on my lap, even though that baby was still crying like okay and we just focus for a minute, focus on what I'm doing. So it was just like a in a moment, in the moment I have my hand on his back, while I'm feeding him. So, he calmed down.\nPAMELA HAYS: I'm thinking of like the three of your hey baby's, let's do a focusing exercise here.\nUNKNOWN: I wish they could understand it.\nPAMELA HAYS: Take a deep breath, but they do respond to you, don't they I mean, you do that and they kind of soothe a little bit.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, because I was trying to make a bottle, I'm scanning the room looking for the pacifier. I'm like I don't know where it is, let me hurry up and make this bottle so this baby won't be hungry. It was a second of chaos, for a moment it was, it was just for a second until I just relaxed myself. And like I say, it's the end of the day, everybody is ready to go home so it was understandable.\nPAMELA HAYS: Have you thought anymore about this idea of your stress level, making listening more difficult to?\nUNKNOWN: I have been thinking about it. And I've also been thinking about the fact that I haven't had a headache lately. So I really think that my stress level is coming down.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh good.\nUNKNOWN: Well, I had one last night, I had homework to do and I did get a headache because I was overthinking of something when it was so simple. But once I just, again relaxed myself and just took a moment I did take a deep breath just to catch myself and like okay, I know what I'm doing. I already had it written out, it was just the fact of putting into words, putting into certain words. So and once I relaxed, my headache went away.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh.\nUNKNOWN: So you told me about the zones like where you feel the stress it did, it went away. I didn't have to take any Aspirin or anything. So I was just like just having just like in those moments, its just focus.\nPAMELA HAYS: Did you started to do that because you cured your forehead pain cured you to do that.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. Oh good, that's really helpful way to use that. Yeah.\nUNKNOWN: Because I had a headache all day yesterday, and then when I get home I was still under the weather and I noticed the headache first, I'm just like \"man my head is hurting really bad.\" So I'm like okay, sit down relax.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. And then how do you figure out that you needed to do, did you figure out something you said you really should needed to organize the homework or something.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, I was looking at two different models. I was looking at the model on a book and a model on a computer and I'm just like it kind of like bugged me out because, it's said to use one model per day and next instances said to use this one, so I'm like okay which one do I use. And I was like okay, well I know how to do this one, so I just went with what I knew. So once just like okay, once I read both of them, I'm like okay, I know how to do this particular model, this is the one I'm going to do.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay. Well, I was looking back over my notes from even the first session when you came in here and I was thinking, I was looking at this whole long list you had of stressors in your life and you know what, you still have them all. I mean they are like a big ones, separation from your husband, parenting your two small kids, working full-time and, well yeah, actually these are two separate working full-time in this stressful job I mean with little kids and then the online school that's pretty full time too, isn't it?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Finances because you are still in school and then the conflicts with your mom and brother. I guess it was like, just like 10.\nUNKNOWN: Right, yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. So l mean on the one hand it's interesting that none of those things have gone away in the last two weeks, but you, well I should ask this as a question first. Are you feeling better than you were when you first came in.\nUNKNOWN: Definitely.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay good, that's good to hear and then isn't that interesting that still all these things, which should be overwhelming to most people are there. But you really are feeling a little better than you were before.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah. Some of the things I'm working on like the full time job that's going to be there, the kids, the separation is going to be there. But I started this week with eating healthier so that's going to help with like my health, my weight and personally how I feel. So, those are going to stop right there, will not stop, but being worked on and in the midst I've also encouraged my co-worker, her husband to join the gym that I have joined, so now we are going to all start going together starting Monday. So, I'm like that's up right there.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, great.\nUNKNOWN: I walked two and half miles yesterday, so these are things that are passes of elimination kind of. So yeah and with my husband, although we are separated we still have really good communication. He came over last night to help me with my homework, so the separation happen, but it doesn't mean that we have to be mean and nasty to each other. So we are still working very well together, very well for the sake of the kids and also just for ourselves because we, even though we are separated possibly leading into divorce we could still be good friends. So that's not like a huge issue because its working out well. And the other things, there will come, there will come times, where I still may stress about it but just being over here to pass six sessions, I have taken away skills to help me with it.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, what do you anticipate as the challenges for you in the coming year? Things where you might, I've talked about sort of the path, the path of wellness and well-being and things that might kind of pull you down off the path even though you stay pointed in the right direction, but might yeah kind of pull you off at the direction you won't go to.\nUNKNOWN: Some of those things maybe a finance one because I have a car note but also I'm looking into getting a home. So this is going to be a long process because I'm going through programs and it's just bank's lending and all of that.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, like buying a house? Wow.\nUNKNOWN: Yes and also well, I'm still schooling I'm on my master's program now. So, I only have one class left of this program, but I'm going straight into my next program. So just to keep my focus with school, don't let buying a house stress me out and don't let the fact that I have more adult bills now with a car note sooner be mortgage or rent. Just trying to keep focused and just assure myself that everything will work out.\nPAMELA HAYS: I can't remember if I asked you this or not about this idea of the values, the things that you value highly, the strong values in your life that can kind of help you stay centered or sort of think those as part of an internal compass that we all have kind of points us towards health and what's good for us and our families. And your priorities on values can help with that like figure out what the best steps are. Are there particular values you hold really strongly that stand out to you?\nUNKNOWN: My faith, my family life those hard to tell(ph) and just like maintaining.\nPAMELA HAYS: What's that mean?\nUNKNOWN: Basically like well-being, not going without. So I guess that can kind of be like a financial thing as well. I'm just to make sure that we are well taken care of.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay. Do you mean like self-supporting or self-sufficient or\nUNKNOWN: Both.\nPAMELA HAYS: That you, are you saying you want to be able to do that yourself for your kids or you mean that just your kids and you are taken care of even if its.\nUNKNOWN: No, I want to be able to do it for myself.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay, yeah. So your faith, your family and taking care of the people you love, including yourself, taking good care of yourself too. And you see that link now I think too between taking care of yourself and taking care of them. Yeah, okay. So I wonder if, I mean this is big question I imagine, something you can just take away with you to think about more later too, think about those three things and how they can help you with the challenges that will come up for you. The schooling challenge, starting this new master's program, which will be stressful, things like your car payments, possible house, buying a house, was that it, the three challenges. Yeah and like let's say if you can't pay your car payment for like a month or two, you're behind finances that you can come back to the those three values you hold, the your faith and your concern for your family and caring for people that those will help you make a decision about what to do about the car like a worst case scenario, you knew you just couldn't keep sustaining the payment and you had to give up, give it up for something like that or you had some other options you were trying to figure out what options to take that holding those values in your head would help you make the decision.\nUNKNOWN: Yeah, especially the faith.\nPAMELA HAYS: How, what do you think in there? How would that work?\nUNKNOWN: With me, I'm just like a little work it out be it, he provides it or he places it on someone else's heart to be able to help.\nPAMELA HAYS: Or sometimes even is it that you recognize you can't, it's not the time for you to have something that you want yeah, but maybe don't need, need.\nUNKNOWN: Right.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. Good, yeah. I think that's, will you remember all those things.\nUNKNOWN: Yes.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay because I write them on the sticky note.\nUNKNOWN: I'll remember.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay, yeah. So your, I'm thinking again about your challenges just kind of red, like red flags like. You are feeling pretty good right now. But things just happen and you might get to a place, where you not feeling so good. And what would be a red flag that you need to do something extra like you need to take some extra part timer, go talk to your pastor or you need to do the focusing exercise or something like that, what are the things you need to watch for in yourself? Or it might be an interaction with other people.\nUNKNOWN: I was just saying those moments where, I'm feeling like I can't achieve something or like I'm not doing my best as something. That will be a time, where I need to like sit back and reflect and just kind of encourage myself or even get encouragement from someone else, if they have it's a gift.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. So I'm thinking of the schooling like if you get into the classes and your master's program and you are feeling like oh my gosh you know that feeling at the beginning of a semester, where you get all the assignments, where they tell you that they are for the whole year and you go or if the whole semester and you go, how can I possibly do all this in one, four months that kind of over load feeling.\nUNKNOWN: Well with that, I'm not going to say it will be easy, but just the fact that I have, people I work with and even my mother in law has her master's in education. So I have people who I can reach out to if need be, even my online support from our school. So, I have people I could reach out to.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, that's great. And the other things I'm hearing in there too is, you have role model?\nUNKNOWN: Yeah.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",
