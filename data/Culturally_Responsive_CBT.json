HAYS: Yeah, okay. I know you filled out a piece of paper with a little bit information you gave me about yourself. Did you have any questions about that?\nTONY: Not really, Pam, no.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Well, just to give you an idea what to expect today.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: This will probably take about an hour and during that time, I will ask a lot of questions to understand how it might be helpful.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You're a councilor yourself, so you kind of know how this goes.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then at the end, I'll save some time and stop and talk with you about my recommendations and my thoughts and kind of what I would suggest in counseling.\nTONY: Okay, good.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: For you to come back, okay.\nTONY: Okay. Sounds good.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: All right. So if it's okay, I'm going to take a few notes here.\nTONY: All right. No problem.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that I don't forget things, okay. We are ready. So, I'll kind of start with medical stuff here. So you've got diabetes?\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I know, yeah, Type-II.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I know the med form and the medication you listed is for diabetes. But I wasn't familiar with the other one.\nTONY: I have this, but -- I can't pronounce.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I didn't either. Is it Tim, maybe you are something like that, yeah. Is that for diabetes?\nTONY: That's for the cholesterol, high cholesterol.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And those are the only meds you're on.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, and no other major medical problems or head injury. Is there anything like that?\nTONY: No, I had something way back when I graduated from Grammar School and that's when I had ruptured spleen and a cross liver ran into a post.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, while walking.\nTONY: No, running, we are just I will take the short version. We just graduated from Grammar School. We were on the school parking lot, playing softball and there was a cut-off basket ball post, but I didn't see and thereby they guessed they were hallowing and I'm trying to catch dragonfly and I guess and I am running for the ball and I hit the post like right here, running at top speed like. And so it was like June and they thought, we went through the house. Then I went to the doctor and doctor said, you can find anything wrong, two or three years later I kind of passed out and I think I had, I don't know how many punch you have in your body or blood, but I think I had like two left, because I had been bleeding internally, so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, well. So ruptured spleen.\nTONY: Yes, this was ruptured spleen and a cross liver.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, does that cause you any problems today.\nTONY: None that I have noticed. I haven't noticed any, because I was in a Marine Corp for 11 years and I did all that oorah stuff.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh! you are. Okay. I'm just -- I always keep track of people sort of strengthen accomplishments and things and that's you were in for 11 years.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So where you overseas or--\nTONY: I went overseas once to Japan, but I was in the Vietnam Aero, but I never saw a combat.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: See, so how about -- kind of, why don't we just start in with why are you -- what brings you here?\nTONY: Well, what kind of brings me here is, having some I guess, and you may want to call them adjustment or acceptance issues with being a \"baby daddy\". So--\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And I know from the -- I had asked you on this form like who your significant relationships are. This is related to your five year old daughter.\nTONY: I have focused in my five-year old daughter and that's sort of when I have focused that I have one -- a son turned three and another daughter who will be eight next month. Those are by different women though.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So because of the five-year old. She lives with you full time.\nTONY: Correct. Her mother passed away from leukemia.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I think you had noted that too and you got some big losses in there as well.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I am wondering how this might be best to ask you about like chronologically or because you have couple of older daughters too right.\nTONY: Correct. I have four older children also.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And can you tell me like their ages and if you have like a name or if you want to just do initials to just -- so I can keep that also.\nTONY: Older one, her name is Aisha. She is 39. She is the eldest daughter and then Anthony Junior, 37. And then you have Quiana, Q-U-I-A-N-A, 35, because her and mine is the same age. So their birthday is actually on the same day, October 4. So that's how I keep up with them.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, nice birthday present.\nTONY: And then Christopher, who is 32, he is the youngest son.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And then where does the 3-year old live.\nTONY: With his mother.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And he is a boy. Yeah, what's his name?\nTONY: Rashad.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I almost forget that. Where does Rashad live. I mean, with his -- where do he and his mother live?\nTONY: His mother -- Southern Illinois. All right. They were in the Chicago area, then they moved to Southern Illinois.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How often do you see -- get to see him?\nTONY: It's been a long time. It's been over a year actually, right. When we were together up until he was two, we all lived together almost every day.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So is there still fair amount of pain related to that.\nTONY: Yeah, it's going to give me the feeling of when my who is with her grandmother and I am starting to get them again, because I was really longing to see her and they were playing games as far as me visiting her and I end up getting full custody of her, but I am kind of getting no same feelings of what I really want to see him and like I can't see him, but I really want to see him and it's only the distance and I don't know. I want to stay scheduled, but it is more than scheduled, because I want to see him, he says you got to come down here see him and when she comes to the city, I don't see him. So I don't just about you.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you feel like she is making it difficult for you, I mean.\nTONY: I kind of think so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you haven't been able to have any contact with him for a year.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated Psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Do they go to your Church?\nTONY: They do not. My mother basically stays at home now instead of going out though. But we will always in this one Church Parkway Christian Church is where we really -- could we say the family church so to speak. But now I actually go to a different church.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What kind of a church is that?\nTONY: My, is a Pastor Hannah. I am going to say pretty much not a denominational, but I was going to the Catholic Church, but only as -- because it was required.

Would you say you have plenty of support like social interaction with people that care about you?\nTONY: Yeah, I could but I'm thinking too, am I need someone else to talk to, maybe a close friend or something that, but it's really hard for me to kind of come fighting people or so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What makes it hard for you?\nTONY: I just really don't want to share my information with you. Even though, we will talk about a lot of different things and sometimes I bring up certain eventful things, but I won't really get deep and I think if some going on, I'd say what do you think they will actually do about this or whatever maybe, even somebody work or something as far as will it be a close one but I will call. Hey, this is going and made that happen.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How about during the times that you have had these losses like the loss of your former wife and--\nTONY: Haven't really spoken with anybody really about it. I mean really I think I can handle it myself as part of life and I can handle it, that's how I feel.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And do you think you have, I mean is it. Does it feel settled. I mean there is -- I think there is things like that still always a little kind of box pain back in there.\nTONY: With Dorothy, who is the mother of the four kids. It's more like even though we were separate because she was in Memphis, I was in Chicago, but it is more like now I will be thinking of things like that happened in the past in our life and I will be like turn up, but I can't ask her. And so she really likes on her mind more now than before, is like I kind of miss her now more than I did before, but I can't -- like I don't know. Who was the guy that lived next door to us, when we were stationed in Twenty Palms(ph) or whatever. Then, I like I can't ask her anything but let me tell the key is this when we did this and let me include her and to tell her how it was or whatever, but then I can't ask you so. That comes above it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is there kind of a sadness connected to it, then.\nTONY: That's -- it's that enough to make me grab but I feel awful that's what we can say in this, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It doesn't pull you down though. It just like momentary.\nTONY: It comes and goes. It will come and go, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: And there could be something underlying too something that maybe having you know but I am not really on the full front experienced it too, right because I can feel something and I don't know. I try to pretty much be in touch with my feelings but I think I am very strong, I can handle all these things.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Do you tend to be pretty cognizant like you go into your head and kind of holding the feelings that way, kind of pushing down?\nTONY: It kind of yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: A lot of times counselors are really good at that.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It really pops out other places sometimes.\nTONY: I know if they are successful and there is a question.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So then you had the loss at Doherty. That occurred about the same time as the break up with your three odds mother roughly I mean.\nTONY: Oh, we have been broken up plus we got a year.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. I thought Doherty was about a year ago.\nTONY: It was actually -- but now up until two years now, Wisha who was a three year just turned three.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh Okay.\nTONY: Actually where you have gone. No we are kind of broken up those.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So that was about a couple of years ago.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And then the custody of my and so how about the relationship with mother.\nTONY: It was good all the way to some like the later months where she get to sick and she be frequently in the hospital. And so we were not limiting. But we got picked like on week-ends. Of course she was saying that, in week-ends and she come over and then I will take back home because she was downtown. So but once you guys sick and kind of leave her in the house anymore. So this is actually to the mother more you know like. I mean she come over frequently and stay with the house but she could have stayed by herself. So stayed with her mother by doing the week.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So how long did you break up with her with Myer's mother.\nTONY: Before she passed.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: We really want broken up. It was just, she was sick and really I noticed this that her mental state was deteriorating. I noticed this. And so sometimes she want to see me sometimes, she didn't want to see me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: But she did say I could go over the houses, she might right but when I went to the houses. So my I have never seen her mother after she passed.

HAYS: What's her name.\nTONY: Timus.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Timus, okay.\nTONY: Is Myers mother.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: So after she, I wonder I was excited go get after they just signed the order, when I go to the police, I got to get my right. That's the first time I saw her mother. So but when I went over there once, only once when she was in hospital because I was sitting in the kitchen and there was like some kind of a surprise visit when this is my child and I felt that I should be able to take her and go on, bring back or whatever, you know. That's the way I felt, still there be another surprise visit, you guys sitting in this chair and like you know her -- wow, this--\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Also you had to do that for a while.\nTONY: When she was in hospital, she said how much you are going to see me. She said, going to the house to see her. I felt very uncomfortable. So I didn't go back over there.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Not to see her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It wasn't like in office children services kind of supervision.\nTONY: No, no, no, no.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, none of that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Just uncomfortable.\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So when did Timus die?\nTONY: She died in December versus this is 14 right of 12. This will be the third year, right, because it cut back in 11 because I had for three, it's gone on three years now.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So how would you describe your relationship with Mike.\nTONY: Oh, we had great relationships. That is great.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: I mean for the past she loves me and I love her and that's like my life for her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So what are the parts about being a dad that are difficult for you.\nTONY: The hair, doing their hair. Okay, but also now that she is getting older and this is that -- this is going to become an issue, I already know because she is asking, before she is asking a lot about her mom, which she knows her mom. I have shown a picture of her mom, but the other side, because she goes there was a mom. And I don't know how they are pushing this issue but I had a issue and this is the first time it happened about three weeks ago and she was saying she wants her mother, I want Timus, I want Timus, I want Timus. And I'm telling her, she can't see Timus, because I'm really trying to get to how, but I handle to death even though she knows she's dead but even though if she knows really the fidelity of she thinks, because where can we go she her and there's even though we went to crematory three, four times -- child and asked all the times she really did that, but I can this becoming more frequent now in the future though, and I'm really, because, I want to even guess some help of people some way or how I could really deal with that issue, because I've really wanted her to enjoy her time, her childhood, I always remember her mother, but still I don't want to that could be the total focus there. My mom died when I was two and then they carry sort of all the way in life and takes away from her live, because two of my counseling years I've been with old counsel people. And then they go back and they say, oh, my mom died when she was two and then I see some issues that they had as a result there. And this is more the one occasion I've seen this. And so I really trying to find how I can -- to never, of course, never forget about your mom or who your mom is whatever, but, of course, your mom is now -- so we don't have to do with that and I want to continue with your life, but that's when my I'm kind of with that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I mean, that sounds --\nTONY: See, that's going to really been now. I have to support my sisters and that I mean her, of course, because I'd be thankful I see why God gave children of two parents, so if one have is other you still have another one. Here which is really, so I stepped up my role on that even with my other four kids. When their mother passed it seems like they need me more now, but they're now my oldest daughters coming kind of distant, because they still think about their mother and stuff. I don't know, so it's kind of.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So when you say that the parenting part of this, it includes kind of challenges with your older kids too, because they've lost their mom.\nTONY: That also, yeah, before I was getting calls like every other day, one of them will call me or even get grandkids, we got a lot of grandkids, but even then with the grandkids. So, yeah, that's part of that too and then it seems like and I wouldn't want to kind of share this with you. It seems like kind of the older kids are jealous of the younger kids even though I treated the older kids just as the same way I'm treating the other kid, I treated them when they were young. But I can hear even though they've come and told me that the boys especially. But I'm sensing this, I'm feeling that really.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What do you think there, what are they touching on when they seem jealous?\nTONY: I guess their focus is when I'm talking about or even though I talk about all of the older ones and younger ones, all are good now, but it's my guess that she's there or not.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Or was it because of the custody you mean, because you didn't have sole custody of them or?\nTONY: Because I've got the sole custody and it seems like, okay, I take away that what it is, what I think it is, lesser teaching for them.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: That's what I think.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. And including attention that you gave them back then or you mean now you're just doing busy.\nTONY: Even now, yeah. Now, because now -- before I was kind of unrestricted, I could travel when I want, now I can't kind of go to.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And what do you do for childcare when you work all days a week?\nTONY: Yes. She actually goes to preschool and then my sister is let's say, my support sister, if I want go somewhere, do something. And then one -- not one weekend, but one 24 hour period a months you goes over her grandparent house, which is Timus' mother, just go be with her cousins.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So your sister babysits too, give you--\nTONY: She will.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: All them are actually were, because thereby loves and overall.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, everybody in your family, anybody will take her.\nTONY: Pretty much, but I will don't let them he will not go, but mainly my older sister, Mary that's the main. That's my primary, if you want to say.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So do you work like 40 hour week too, you gone five days a week all in school too, all right. Okay, yeah. That's right. And you're doing BA, an entrepreneurship, is that right?\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How is that going for you?\nTONY: Great. It's going great. Challenging, but great.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good. What are you hoping to do with that?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

But we're putting together something called ex-offender university, the learning center for the ex-offender where he can come and get and be like a one stop shop, including substance abuse program specifically designed and targeted to ex-offender.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How neat.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, this is great.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well.\nTONY: That's where I'm with that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you said that the -- oh, one, let's see, let me ask that. Okay, let's see. You'd said as the main thing you are coming here for help with is acceptance, kind of, acceptance of or adjustment to being a dad to baby daddy.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yes, a baby daddy with my, yeah, and--\nTONY: Now my with the other two that's the two children then I'm not the custodial parent.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nTONY: That's what the relation for me, because first of all, I never wanted to be in this situation and it's really went all way, because I'm like a hands on there. And I don't know how it really having this distant relationship, this distant dad thing, I've really as where know me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So okay, yeah, I was misunderstanding. So if everything is things are--\nTONY: How can I parent a child when I'm not there. No, I don't want to stand how I could do that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. With three old Rashad and then Ariel.\nTONY: And then Ariel.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, yeah, we did that, right. And then a year old Ariel. And where is Ariel?\nTONY: They just moved to Richton Park. So that's close. With their farther down Indiana somewhere, not even go there.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And is this situation with Ariel's mother kind of similar to the ones with Rashad's mother kind of though you've called she's making that a little difficult or?\nTONY: Not really making that difficult. We can talk, but we don't get any places far, so how we're going to actually parent her. So I'd say let her come out to the house at least just initially to start when we get a month, spend a weekend and then I bring her like, pick up Friday and Saturday and bring her back Sunday, so I'm like that, so we can build up relationship with her, but now she says, Ariel wants to go to ballet and she wants to do a lot of different extra-curricular activities, which kind of -- it kind of prevents that in a way for her to come in or schedule. And then its more you can come and do this, you can do that and dad when I think what can we kind of do this together.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You mean including the mom, both together.\nTONY: Well, not together like that as far as you can bring her, I'll have to always come get her investigate, it's something like that. That's kind of some agreement with this and this execute our plan.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So wouldn't you have Rashad and Ariel, you do find when you with them, that's not the problem. Is that correct?\nTONY: Wait a minute. You said, when they're by me now.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, the difficulty for you really comes with the mothers more coordinating with the mothers to get access and be with the kids when you're actually with the kids, you enjoy them and they enjoy you and you have a good relationship.\nTONY: Yeah, we have really good relationship, but it could be better, because this is still distant, I'm not there. She may see me once or twice a month, I mean, and that's not a lot of long time even. I get her and mine to get her when I could has been a while since we both went out together, but I have to think about even something we can do both, but we went, ice skating down, and maybe here last I would gather me here and see my love is distant and she wants us been a lot of time with her sister. And so as far as her going over there, to stay over there Ariel's mom, which is Nicky is and what she's got just three old, who gives her handful so she can't have any other kids, she can't handle any more kids. So that's what she is.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Yeah, so this is as we could go.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, okay. Those not frequent enough that you get to see them accesses kind of problem, it's difficult coordinating and then and that affects the relationship too, because.\nTONY: Oh, yeah. Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Then I kind of -- as you are talking on making sort of listing stressors in your life that that are affecting how are you doing now and you have been writing down these relationship losses and then the parenting challenges at a distance and then your health also with -- is that a worry for you or you feel pretty stable here?\nTONY: No, I'm trying to be as healthy as I can even though I feel I could be a lot healthier than this, just by doing some more exercise and I've been doing some more like old man exercises there, but I need to remain healthy, because I wanted to be a role model as long as I can for these children, because I enjoy them.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You were kind of exercising, are you lifting weights or?\nTONY: The old man exercise like doing this or so, give a 25, going to knee, stretch that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you walk at all?\nTONY: I walk a lot.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good, okay.\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And eating healthy.\nTONY: When I can.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you cook for yourself then and Mai.\nTONY: I cook, yes, she loves when I cook that often, but I love to cook. But sometimes I was just crazy.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, yeah, you've got to be super busy, I mean, if you're working full time you have a five year old, you do pick her up, drop her often guessing and then you have other kids calling you and you've got your own health issues to deal with and you have a lot in your plate, it is not like your job isn't stressful?\nTONY: Well, it's stressful only when I'm there, because I've kind of learnt how now not to take this to home with me and my head even though sometimes one or two sneaking has been some kind of doing best counseling. That gives, I see, that what the, but I try my best not to take with me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Are there any other stressors, I mean, that's plenty, but--\nTONY: For now that's enough. You know I love my job, but let's leave it at that. I love my job, but it's maybe it could be sometimes just for dealing with the other side. That's how I see.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.

HAYS: Okay, so you know yourself well and you know how much energy you have and you don't have it right now, but you can figure yourself moving in that direction.\nTONY: I'll have the energy or the resources right now, but I'm working on it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay. And what are you doing in that regard how do you sort of the self-care thing there or what do you that to helping up church.\nTONY: To get my energy?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I mean, church is one thing right.\nTONY: Yeah, I'm trying to keep myself in most relief fit and that will really give me down, because I'm thinking there's things I can do, I just can't do them right now. There's things I can put in place is just right now, I can put them in place to whatever the situation.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How are you sleeping?\nTONY: That's a good question. I wakeup almost every night 1 to 2 o'clock AM and mind is wasting in and I'm trying to control my mind but that's almost every night. I don't know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And how is your appetite?\nTONY: Appetite is great.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Do you have any troubles concentrating or?\nTONY: Concentrating good. Concentration is good. Just when I wakeup and I can't sleep. I have to lay there for the while and then go back to sleep eventually. Because I'm just kind of close to getting out, but, yeah, I wake up during the night and I can't sleep sometimes, I mean its take some minute, you know, to go back. But 1 to 2 o'clock I can count like clock were and I'm going to wake up.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Kind of worrying, huh?\nTONY: Yeah, it worries me somewhat in my mind, but I use my mind. But it does, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So what do you see as your strength and supports that could be religious, cultural and personal, internal you think you've mentioned your faith.\nTONY: I'm pretty a determined person. I think what I can kind of communicate going well with people. And I know I just have this energy drive that would have put my mind to do something, I can accomplish it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you've been successful in that, because you have--\nTONY: Pretty much.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay. Well, is there anything I haven't asked about that you think is important to mention.\nTONY: Those are about the main things today that's going to my mind.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: All right, well. Let me stop there and just kind of summarize for you what I'm thinking.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: When I'm trying to understand where somebody is -- how somebody is feeling or if they're having some anxiety which sounds like you are having some like worry in the middle of the night and you certainly have reason too. I look at three things. The first thing I look at is vulnerability to anxiety or depression or anger based on childhood experiences. I don't know that you have any real vulnerability to that, I'm not hearing that in your description of your childhood. Would you say that?\nTONY: I pretty much agree with that. Even though I've always had two close friends though. I've always had two close friends. In childhood, I had two close friends, in the military, I had close two friends. But later in life, I don't have those two close friends.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, yeah. Okay, so well, I don't get to that, I mean, actually the support part. But so, it sounds like based on your childhood, you had pretty good childhood pretty stable and yeah, that's in your favor. So that's a first thing I look at. The second thing I look is stressors. And well, you have a lot, I mean, you have a lot and you have a huge, I mean in the span of two or three years you've had the death of your former wife, the mother of your four children, oldest children, you've had the death of Mai's mother, just pretty recent, three years ago or so, two or three years ago. And then the breakup with Rashad's mother and the loss of him really in some ways, immediate custody of him. You have really the big losses. And so and then that your own health issues. The parenting at a distance challenges, which is really put a star right next to that because the big right now. Your job, I mean, being a substance abuse counselor is not stress less, it sounds like its rewarding to you and you like it and you have a great forward plans that with entrepreneurship degree and your university you're going to start, that's exciting. But still there is stress there. And then a lot of the whole thing with the court battles too to get custody. And then your mom's health also. So those are huge. Just that alone is big. And then the third thing I look at is, in addition to vulnerability and stressors are supports, because one thing we know is the more support you have the more stress you can handle. And in this field the more support, if a person doesn't have a lot of support then even small stressors can feel pretty overwhelming.\nTONY: Could be.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So and you have some really good solid support in family, but you also have the loss of -- you don't have the two close friends you normally have.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So I'm not surprised that maybe feeling overwhelmed or you didn't use that word, but was that into your times.\nTONY: Good word to use, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that big question. Okay, what you do about it? Well, to your counsel, you know the phrase cognitive behavior therapy. Do you use some of that with your clients?\nTONY: I use CBT in my most of the time, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, good. Well, I'll just describe it to you kind of the way that I think of it. I look at problems and the solutions in two main categories. So the ones where you can take some action like to change something in your behavior or your environment. And then the ones that you can't do anything about like a chronic medical condition where you've done everything medical, but you're still stuck with it or it is somebody else's behavior and you've kind of done everything on your part, but you still care directly change their behavior. But with those kind of problems there is one thing we know. We know that the way we think about the problem, effects, how we feel about it. So there are thing you can say over and over to yourself that what really pulled you down, making more discouraged, but the converse is true that there are things that you could say ways to interpret other people's behavior, I know, that will help you feel more encouraged, little more inspired even given the problem.\nTONY: Yeah, I tried some of that too. Some of that -- it's been a flatted down, so to speak.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I mean, I'm sure you do some of this in your life, because if you didn't, I don't see how you be here with everything you have going on.\nTONY: Correct.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Just that's perfect.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And the way I get it that homework is at the end of each session, I'll ask you this question. Okay, based on what we talked about today, what's the smallest possible step you could take that feel like you're making progress. And I emphasize smallest possible step for two reasons. One is that, I wanted to be 100% sure that you do it, because that will increase your feeling of success and you'll be more have to do in next little step and after a few steps you'll feel like okay, really, I'm on the right path. If you kind of think of the path of wellness or well-being and then there's other path, I want to get you going in in that path, in that direction, right. You're further down that path. And then the other reason is that you have a ton on your plate, you're super busy and these things need to be easy to integrate into your life, where it's not difficult, because there are things that will help you to continue the rest of your life, not just why you're super stressed right now.\nTONY: Okay, I kind of get you, don't overwhelm myself. But I'm already overwhelmed.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And in fact, when usually people come to see me, it is like in the -- say when I use this hand motion to say, it just feels overwhelming, because you've got so many things going on in there all interconnected, like, okay, if I fix this, but I still got this and then there's this. That the only way I know out of that is to just take one small step. And there's something about the one small step that's a little energizing, it's a little inspiring that then can you to take the next little step and those little -- the first little step or the second isn't going to solve it all. But again, it just get you further down the right path.\nTONY: Leading to something.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yes.\nTONY: Okay. That's good.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So how does that sound?\nTONY: Sounds really good, I'm seeing already a thing and what supposed if I could take though.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Good, you're going right where I was going to go.\nTONY: When I was saying that and I was thinking -- and I've really wanted to, but I won't. Still it's coming off tough by here, I really want just a second to think about what small step I could take now. One I think I could take is kind of not going to work, try to do something with Rashad right now as far as Rashad because he's hit the brick wall right now on that deal. But what I can't do on the other hand with Ariel is, as she is closer is I could find some time to go over there to their house and really starts get something rolled in over there. Start going to see her possibly and then a little more. Just to start that off, so this is kind of bit of -- even if it's right after I get out the school or whatever and go over there for hour or two or whatever something like that. Might be my small step on that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So and thinking about how to keep this realistic and really doable for you, because we talked about unlike normally most people come to counseling once a week, but we're going to do this in a more intensive like Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Monday, Wednesday, Friday. So would you be able to do that between now and Wednesday, today is Monday and Wednesday or?\nTONY: It'd be hard, because I have to do it tomorrow.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: If not, if there would be a tiny, tiny piece of that like it might even just be calling Ariel's mother.\nTONY: Okay, to set up something.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Okay, well, I'll try to -- did that yesterday, she said, can you just want to buy and it's going to be a doctor in Chicago, week up until Thursday, but I could call and set up something.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And see that's the part that's in your control, right, and you can do that, that's your next step and then we can just kind of go from there.\nTONY: Because we call on the phone all the time, I can call her over the phone on time, just physically being there is what the thing is. And as she was resting in hospital, I went down to see in the hospital and see, but that was just -- to me that was just episode when I was want to have a relationship already is to just being and I don't know the word I trying to use here, but still being just episode there or something is going to thank God, and I want to always have this relationship already, so I'm already even aware and until we're obviously going to doctor next week, I even go with you, whatever somewhat there and it's just oh, she is asking for and now you go and come see your daughter. No, I don't want to just be like that. I want to be Pam, but I.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So with the -- giving her a call between now and Wednesday.\nTONY: I could do that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And would it feel like, yeah, it is going down, it's a step in the right direction, it's a little more than you would have done normally between now and Wednesday.\nTONY: That would be perfect. I feel right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, well, good, well then I'll ask you about that next time you come.\nTONY: Okay. That would be perfect.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I guess, that's it then for today.\nTONY: All right, Pam. Thank you.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, you're welcome. Glad if you could come in.\nTONY: Yes.

So good, I mean the homework went well then, better even then I mean we anticipate it might even just be a call that she wasn't even there or something just --\nTONY: That was the case because like I said, I called and I texted her, and call when you get time and so then I finally called her and I called her again because I knew I want to have something to report when I came back, so and they she finally answered that's when we talk.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Good, good.\nTONY: Right. So, I feel kind of good about it, what I don't feel so good about is, me finding this time so I got to really look at my schedule and see whether I really have some time. But we always say we are going to come out one weekend a month. We are going to sit down, we're going to discuss what's the best we can for her, what's the best we can for me, because her schedule was she is doing the gymnastics and she's doing this praise dance in the church. So I said, okay, I'm just going to sacrifice pick her up Friday early evening and then take her to her practice on Sunday morning or Sunday - early Sunday afternoon. So that give a little time, she can come over and spend a night or whatever so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So she'd be with you Friday night and Saturday night?\nTONY: Actually, it'll only be Saturday, it will be lesser than 25 hour period, but at least it will be a start I think.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: For now.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Good.\nTONY: For now. So it will be like Saturday, Saturday evening to Sunday. So in Sunday depending what time her appointment is, I think it's one or two when she'll get to be at her practice. But it's a start - it's a start I think.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that seems a little -- pretty easy, I mean was it hard to do to call her?\nTONY: No, no. It's easy to talk to -- we can talk to -- it's like but, let's not talk about it, let's -- we have always communicated, but let's we just only talk, so now it's something I got to do on my end and something she's going to do on her end.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Have you had this kind of an interaction before like where you haven't had contact in a while and then you have contacted her, she's spend amount to-(ph) to open to working something out and then you realize, Oh, my gosh! I don't know if I can do this with my schedule. Or some other way that's between the fact?\nTONY: No. It wasn't a period like that, it was just we laid the cards on the day as far as what's available and then it was like the big problem was making that happen in that time frame.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: All right.\nTONY: That was the biggest deal. It was like remains the promises, they didn't come true. It was just like, it's like you're making something concrete and then sticking to.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, you're super busy aren't you?\nTONY: Pretty much.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's what I'm wondering is if whether this realistic aspects of this two because you said you're getting a little worried about whether you could actually do this?\nTONY: Yeah, finding the time, yeah this is where the whole, an issue thing came about as being a hands-on Dad or being a distant dad, that's what the whole problem comes in it, because even if I was super busy, we're in the same household, it would be no -- be so easy, well, then, dad's working hours but he's still home, so it wouldn't be a problem. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, you -- yeah the way you put it last time was, what you wanted to work on was to be more to adjust to and be more accepting of been a daddy to these kids, to Richard and Ariel in particular, the three-year old and eight year old, because with Myne you do it well, because she is with you.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But it's when you don't have custody and when they're not around, that it's really harder to maintain a relationship.\nTONY: It is.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And Richard's at the same distance also?\nTONY: No, Richard is farther, I don't know how far it is, where he actually is -- it's like southern Illinois, I know exactly where it is. But it's Southern Illinois two hours I think, two hours.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Each way?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh yeah, that really is far.\nTONY: It's like two hours, that makes a little dampen the play. So -- I don't know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, do you have picture of what this would look like if you had -- if you were adjusted and accepting of this like the way you want it would want it to be?\nTONY: I can't -- let me think, let me think, let me think, somewhat I feel more comfortable that -- I feel more comfortable that I'm actually doing my job as a father and a parent. That's how I feel that I'm actually parenting the child even if it's for short time. I don't really feel that, that's possible right now.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: And we know, as far as it really being a part of your life because we don't spend a lot of time together, I don't know, that's really part of our family I think to me, you know and to be a father is this really seriously that's the most part that bothers me.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Yeah. So that's the other piece I was wondering about is the logistics part, like what it looked like in terms of would you -- so you work from 8 to 2:30, is that right?\nTONY: 6:30, 2:30.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: 6:30 to 2:30, Monday to Friday, and then do you imagine yourself --\nTONY: I get up like 4:30 or 5 O'clock.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Wow, wow. I know you.\nTONY: By 5'O clock just say 5'O clock.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you get up at 5'O clock you get ready to go to work, and you get Myne ready to go to work.\nTONY: Correct, correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then you take, does your sister come home and get her?\nTONY: I take her to a day care.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: To day care?\nTONY: Right. That's 6:30, put her to day care, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And so then you go to work yourself? 6:30, they're all there till 2?\nTONY: Yes, 2:30 yeah. Actually my start time is 6:30 now, but then they become 7. As so that's what 6:30 to 2:30.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But you're often in 2:30, right?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay so then you're done at 2:30, do you go pick up Myne or --\nTONY: Yeah. Sometime I stay, at work between 2:30 and 3, I just stay there and if I got to catch up on few things it depends, so well, I'm out there like 3, then I go pick her up, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then what you do?\nTONY: Then we go home.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, so you get home about what? 3:30-ish?\nTONY: Few minutes away. So 15, 20 minutes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, so 3:30, you should pack up.\nTONY: 3:30, not later than 4'O clock.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And what time you have to put her to bed?\nTONY: Myne don't like to go to bed so about 9:30.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is that about when you go to bed too?\nTONY: I try to go later if I can, but it doesn't work all the time. So 9:30, 10 we are basically in the bed.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Because you're tired. And I would think you would be tired.\nTONY: I used to stay up late, I used to stay up late, she used to be in bed, but I used to stay up late. I used to go to bed like 11'O clock-ish and get up at that time of time of 5, yeah but I've been realizing I need more sleep, so I've been forcing myself to go and sleep earlier, turn off the television and go to sleep.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So and between 3'O clock and 3'30-ish and 9 when you put her to bed I mean you have a lot to do right?\nTONY: Correct, correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You're making dinner and -\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But she has homework, at 5?\nTONY: Yes she has - yeah, they do their homework because they're preparing her for kindergarten, where she's actually going, so they're getting her trained, but she's actually a pretty good pre-school. So, yeah and that's part -- a routine part of the day.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then how about weekends?\nTONY: Weekends, Saturday I have a project I work on every Saturday. So I work on my project and then my sister keeps it for me and then I pick her up at 4, 4:30, I pick her up and we'd only go home or go eat or something, do something like that. Sunday at least twice a month, we go to church, and then sometimes, we just lay around.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is that because, you're just tired?\nTONY: Yes kind of, I need to recharge sometimes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I would think, because that's pretty much go, go, go.\nTONY: Oh yes, six days a week pretty much.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Alright.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that's why I was wondering about in terms of fitting in Ariel and Richard, where do you see them, where do you see the space for that?\nTONY: I see that initially when we get them on.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: And these are the time period, I was saying about the Saturday because not every Saturday I do this project, some Saturdays. And then so I can see maybe that one weekend on Saturday, Sunday, the only time that I could see.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And are you thinking that you have them both at the same time? Same weekend?\nTONY: There will be take a lot of planning, so I don't know how those go, I really don't know. I'd probably start with one person and try to add the other one in.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: That's what that have to do. Now, Myne goes to see her grandparent, one weekend a month, actually a 24 hour period, from Friday to Saturday, right. So, that's where that is.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But I thought you said last time, Myne really like Ariel.\nTONY: She does --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But she wants to be there when Ariel comes. Yeah, and vice-versa? Does Ariel like Myne?\nTONY: I don't think it's mutual even though she cares about it but I don't think there's mutuality, am Myne really like her, well, I want to go see my sister, I want to go see my sister. Because Ariel has two more sisters at her house.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Plus she's older one, eight is quite a bit older than five.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How do they both feel about Richard?\nTONY: They actually, Ariel has never met, Richard, Myne has met Richard, she likes Richard, we call him dude so she likes him. She could see dude, yeah, she used to see him a lot, because we're together, but now, she has -- I want to see dude, I want to see dude or when I get the picture I show the picture whatever. So she really wants to see him now, and Ariel -- Myne has this even though I have the four older kids, and also the two, but she still suffers from the single child syndrome. So she thinks she is only Myne.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Wants the attention, all the attention?\nTONY: Yes, yes oh yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Three year old children want that too?\nTONY: Yeah, oh yeah I agree.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, so together it might not work so well.\nTONY: No, because I want get these, this is going to be difficult, but I want to give each some individual in the some the collective types. So I don't know how this is going to work out. I did have a plan at one time and it involved me let's see how we're going to say this, involved me not so much working the 9 to 5, and getting my whole organization, I got to my last time after well which will kind of free me off some time, because I set my own schedule.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: When would that happen?\nTONY: Well, it's actually in motion now, so realistically in the next six months it could happen.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Because you graduate in May, the next month right?\nTONY: Oh, no, no, no. My graduation time is going to be well, but as far as the organization become operational, that's just really in motion as we speak. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: This is the substance abuse treatment program for -\nTONY: Yeah. Choice act NNP(ph) Yes, yes, yes.

HAYS: And the homework you chose to do with that kind of thing, a behavior like change, like an action you choose to call Ariel's mom and yeah, and that was great. So then the other category though were the things you can't change were out of your control, all you can do is change the way you think about them so you are not so distressed by them.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So I'm wondering with this situation, the -- your goal what you wanting here is to be better adjusted or more accepting with parenting Ariel and Richard from a distance. Do you see, like is there a component like a behavioral action component to this as well as a cognitive component that the behavioral action part might be that you need to make some things happen, do something's differently whereas the cognitive piece might be something like changing some way you're thinking that's preventing you from getting to where you want to be which is more accepting of it, better adjusted to it that kind of thing?\nTONY: Are you saying more action?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, I don't know. It seems like there could be component, both components there are things you need to do set this up, this kind of relationship that you want with them. There are practical kinds of things you have to do, right? Behavior changes, like you have to figure out a way to be with them in this case, you are looking at one weekend a month with Ariel as a starting point.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And that's kind of an action piece changing your behavior or so, because you may have to connect with her mom and arrange that and set that up.\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then I'm wondering if there is a cognitive component to -- like a mental component here too where you when somebody says I want to be more accepting of something, it makes me think -- wonder, oh okay so are you not accepting of this, are you angry about this, are you frustrated? Do you have some feelings connected to this that maybe hurting you or causing you stress?\nTONY: I won't say angry, I won't say angry, okay, I won't say angry kind of disappointing somewhat that I play the major part of this of course in this happening but now the consequences are not so much what I expected. And then I have less control of the situation, when I wish I had more control. So that part is kind of -- it's more of a disappointing that I have created this and now wow, it's creating more problems, to be together is really, is more and more and more to it so, that part is where you know me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is it disappointment in yourselves or in them or both?\nTONY: Somewhat with -- lot of it is me and myself, because when we're at it -- don't know if you remember I told you last week I never want to be in this situation initially.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh okay, actually I didn't catch that.\nTONY: Yeah, I never wanted to be in this situation as far as this to that or whatever, I didn't want to put myself so yeah, any one to initially the first with Ariel, that really for me they even had accepted that happen it took a minute for me to really accept it. Seriously, it did. And --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you mean like only a minute or more than a minute?\nTONY: A minute, but a minute -- when I say a minute, it took me a while.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah okay. The opposite of a minute.\nTONY: It took me a while to really accept that. And then I came to realization that it is, what it is and I set flowers on to the house to that this was after maybe she was about three months old, I had bought a baby bed all those stuff she did this, material stuff never really want to be a part of it until I said to myself, it is where it is and you got to do what you got to do. So, yeah but initially even when if she first said, I'm pregnant, kind of like wow, you know, well you know kinda like now I'm in this situation is that I never wanted to be in.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. And actually at that point you haven't been in, right because with Dorothy, you did you have shared custody of the four?\nTONY: Yeah, I always thought of them.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Okay.\nTONY: Right, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did you get divorced after there were all raised?\nTONY: Oh yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh okay. Yeah, yeah so you really because Ariel is the oldest of the younger ones.\nTONY: Right, the other ones in -- Christopher is the youngest one, he is 32.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, so you've got the four adult children and then the children -- children to three, Ariel is the oldest of those?\nTONY: Correct, correct. Alright.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Okay. You know I would think in that situation anger would be a normal response, if it was big surprise you want to plan on this, I mean you recognized you part in it but on the other hand it's like -- oh boy! just kind of redo my life here.\nTONY: Yes that's true what you just said, yeah. It sounds like well, I really won't to believe it at first and then we thought about alternatives of course and it was like having the child, so just, as we give prepared for that. So -- and here we are.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And it's something that -- it's not that socially acceptable to be angry about something like that right?\nTONY: I can't -- well I think this could be socially acceptable for that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh yeah, I do too but I am just saying that I think cancerous people who work in this field will tend to be really good at self-talk, sometimes to the point that we sort of push down feelings.\nTONY: True, true that's yeah but these came up even though I suppressed our real feelings but they came up the angering stuff and the disappointment they came up and I am really was like what really am I going to do, seriously, what am I really going to do and then I really wasn't accepting that before Myne, because I keep saying to Myne, but you know bit of time, and it took me like three months to really say okay this is what it is that's what I they would add it to as far as become an apartment, and she was in Chicago then actually.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right in the city?\nTONY: Yes, she was actually in Chicago, so I could see her when I wanted to, even though she was young and when on and off it was more time spend, more time spend, but then I said, we're packing up, going to Bloomington and when they moved to Bloomington Indiana and that was some years like three years and four years or so, I don't know exactly, but three or four years they moved, but then they recently just moved back last year right so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Back to the Illinois area.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, but not Chicago. Not in town?\nTONY: Yeah, just 45 minutes away, I was telling you.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: The 45 yeah okay, yeah, right.\nTONY: Right in this area, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So do you feel like you have worked through that kind of that you are at a place of acceptance of being Ariel's dad an active parent?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Good. Okay.\nTONY: Right. And I even used to teach a father who had class when I worked at the prison so, listen to the guy, myself and I shared some of this with them and so --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you have good experiences where you've heard how other people reacted to, to this kind of thing?\nTONY: Yeah, most of the time they blamed, they warned me, but it took to had that her father took too to take acceptance for your part that you played in this.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But I think also that can help to hear that other people have the same kind of feelings you have. I don't think emotions are a lot of time emotions aren't so much the problem as what we do with them.\nTONY: Correct. Yes I agree. I agree.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So now the anger and frustration is kind of gone down some to the level of disappointment you are saying?\nTONY: Yeah, that's gone, the part that had happened -- the disappointing part of that, I let that happen, or allow that to happen although has gone, now that disappointment is me and how can I parent this child being a distant dad that's where my frustration is coming in at.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: That's where my frustration is coming in.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So now the emotion that's more disturbing is the frustration about it.\nTONY: Now, I am frustrated. How can you do this, okay, you take it to the doctor, you take to Tony, but when you got to time to do all those, oh my God, now it's like and I was only thinking about this all the way here. It sounds kind of easy get off 2:30 and come to school here on Tuesdays, so I could go over there, spend a lot of time. It sounds really easy but it's really hard, seems like.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, it doesn't sound easy to me. So--\nTONY: Yeah that parts -- get off board but then you go to get it before 3 to 5 O clock oh my goodness.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, you are already getting up at 5, 4:35 every morning.\nTONY: Right, they want to say good bye and then that's one like I said to me it sounds to me kind of easy but working it out is the hard part like she's saying, yeah, you could take her to the doctor, you can do this, you can do that, and I am saying wow man when you got time to do this but I want to down this but when do I actually have time to do this is really the frustrating part.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Very much, so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, also I think I read somewhere this idea of buffer time, that you need buffer time between events or things you do because everything doesn't work according to plan especially when you are talking about kids.\nTONY: So true.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: So I don't know. That will give us some serious thought when I leave here and see what kind of talent make my -- I have a mental schedule, I am pretty much scheduled from Monday through Saturday, so I have got to look at the schedule and see where we can squeeze something in there. Hopefully I can, that's the only thing.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that's the part of the action piece you are trying to figure out what you can do differently to make this work?\nTONY: Yes, and the period to make it work yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then the mental part, I am wondering are you beating yourself up about this or being really hard on yourself about it?\nTONY: Probably with Richard more because I went into a brick wall trying to get anything established on that, so sometimes I have been myself up on that. With Ariel this kind of we got to open communication, but noticed no action yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So you are doing well, but you could blame yourself for the action part too I suppose.\nTONY: As far as with Ariel?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's what I am wondering, you blaming yourself about that too?\nTONY: That's is much but I do, I do because I can say we just had this conversation on the phone today and it was like okay you can do this, you can do that, now people just say, wow when you got the time to do this and people probably look at it like, I'm assuming they're looking at me like when does he spend time with everybody. It seems like as soon as I got custody of Myne then all these other things came into play like and then you see like there was a lot of jealous and envy of this now what about the other child over here, what about her over here and then he'd like, well, he got time to do this, he got time to do that with the other two. So I start getting pressure too.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's from the older kids, right?\nTONY: That was from them and from Ariel's mom, even though it's kind of underline but you could feel even with I even sensed that with Richard, when I first got custody because that took away from her and then I know she's going to take away from Richard.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You said when you got custody of Richard?\nTONY: No when I got custody of Myne.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Of Myne?\nTONY: I felt that from Richard, because it was like okay now he is taking time from Richard and he is going to take time from her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Was that in yourself or you mean Richard's mother was kind of stay with her too?\nTONY: No, yeah her mother his mother.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, Richard's mother was resenting a little bit.\nTONY: Right. Yeah, I sensed all of that, even felt some of that. Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: This feels pretty big to me. I mean this like,\nTONY: It actually we've seen it other way in what we outlined last week and this is wow, it's a lot of dynamics, a lot of pieces to do this puzzle to me but I -- that's why I am that's why I'm sitting here, that's why I am taking to you, so you could help me open for suggestions come up with some way this is going to get better in my life. That's what I am looking at.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, I think I said this last time that when it is so huge and everything sort of seems interconnected, which there is a lot of that in your situation, the only way I know out of it is just to take a small step and then it energizes you a little bit to take another small step and it's not, it's better to kind of look at as a path you are going down figuring out the path you want to be on because you are not going to do this perfectly right with seven kids.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I mean you are not going to make seven kids happy all the time and be able to take care of yourself too which you have to do some of that.\nTONY: True.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Because if you don't you won't have any energy for any of them.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right. Yeah, yeah.\nTONY: Yeah. I don't know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So this thing you did last time that was a good first step and the actually --\nTONY: The first step.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Actually, those are really good first step, I mean it turned out even better than you may have expected.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well I think that's a question, would you agree?\nTONY: I think it did, I feel good about it, now that I feel good about -- now the next step is what really going to make me feel, if I compensate it, making it happen.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

I mean --\nTONY: I really don't know. I am going to take a look at my schedule and I am going to really take a look at it and see how Tony how can you do this?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Because you don't want to set yourself up to fail, you know to think --\nTONY: I won't even go if I think, it's not going to work.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right, yes.\nTONY: I won't.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you can only do so much. I mean you got to sleep too, right?\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So it make sense to me that you are starting with Ariel, as a starting point?\nTONY: Yeah, it's closer.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right.\nTONY: Got to open lot of communication and I think that would be best way to go for now that will kind of ease me up, just say halfway because in the other half is Richard, so that will ease me up halfway as far as my mental status or whatever, ease some of that are making the step, but then if I can really accomplish something on that end, it will give me more encouragement so to speak to go ahead and pursue this other will, that's what I am thinking.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, and that makes sense because you seems to be somebody who has a strong sense of wanting to be a good father. That's a really core value to you, you want to do it well and so whatever you do that helps you do, whatever you do in that regard will help you feel better about yourself.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Which will then give you a little more energy maybe to do a little more, but at the same time, it seems like you got to be careful about doing too much, expecting too much of yourself, too.\nTONY: Oh yeah, it's tough situation.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: We -- I almost always ask people about finances too is a stressor and I didn't ask you that the last time but I would think that would be one as well, single parent in you is that a factor because you mentioned that you were sort of gearing up to take on the custody thing with Richard and yeah.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But you know it takes energy and resources.\nTONY: Correct, correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You're not there yet, is that a factor too kind of the financial piece?\nTONY: It isn't I don't know if you will explain that, but these are pretty good right now. They are not great, but they are pretty good right now. We are not so suffering, we are okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, it's not a source of stress right now?\nTONY: No, no, no. I just think it'll start being that more and I will be ok and stuff. I could do more. I see my budget increasing right there and so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: With all your spare time?\nTONY: Yes. Yeah. I wish.\nTONY: As my past to say, I am living in the overflow right now so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you tend to be hard on yourself? Do you think you are hard on yourself?\nTONY: Not, not, I don't really, I don't think in this situation yes, in this situation. But I found myself in some this is not the way I really want, it's strange situations and going back to the Marine Corp days, I'll never forget but finally myself after I joined Marine Corp and I had these yellow footprints that you get only yellow footprints and that's when all hell breaks loose and I am sitting there and I am standing there on this yellow footprints and I am thinking that Tony, how did you get yourself into this one?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What is that, I don't know what that is.\nTONY: When you get off the bus they have, the Marine Corp recruit depot, they have these yellow footprints already lined up and thereby I get off the bus and I land upon these yellow footprints and that's one day you probably never forget, because everybody is hotter then doing this and doing that but you are hearing all these strange noises and but the thing about this, I say in my mind I am saying that how did you get yourself in this one. So it's like but I love it minute after the initial part, but it is just a fact that you would live in this life you graduated from a high school, you could win over the college or whatever and here I find yourself for this yellow footprint strange people.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, so--\nTONY: Now, I am in another situation, now tell me how to get yourself into this one?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you feel like you are on the yellow footprints now?\nTONY: Not once but twice.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: In this situation. So, but see, the second time is a little different with Richard is no different, so because we actually had a relationship and planned on getting married, then that also fell apart but yeah, so.\nPAMELA A.

We are going to do this is month and then we'll have them maybe plan again for another month but that will be something I had to realistically look at.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So that sort of in terms of these two domains like paying attention to doing something differently versus like watching how you are thinking is affecting how you feel, this is more of an action thing, another action thing.\nTONY: That's action thing, correct.\nPAMELA A.

Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Great. So I'm guessing from the piece of paper there that you did the homework?\nTONY: Well, this morning when I went to work, that was the first thing I did.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh! Good.\nTONY: Because I figured if I started it, then I have time throughout the day to work on it. And it's really kind of, it is brief, I have to kind of explain to you when you are ready?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, yeah, go ahead.\nTONY: I'll go ahead with.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Sure.\nTONY: Okay. So basically Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday is basically the same.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know what, I think, I might write it done.\nTONY: Okay. Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Just so I can get it straight. Okay. So, go ahead.\nTONY: Monday, Tuesday -- Monday to Friday is basically the same schedule. And as with me getting up possibly 4:30; leaving house by 6; being at the day care 6:30; then working from 6:30 to 2:30, and picking up Mai between 3:00 and 3:30. Okay, that's basically the same. Then after work is basically picking her up, going home, eating, unwinding, you know, maybe watch a little television or something, but it might depend what's going on.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you get phone calls too during that time, like from your many kids, adult kids?\nTONY: There is a great possibility, one of them could call, yes, there is possibility, or family because I go see my mother too. I don't really -- that's not really a scheduled thing, those I don't want to schedule, but during that times, yeah, probably that could happen.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But it takes time too, you know.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I mean if your mom calls, and says, could you come over, or one of your adult children calls and they want to talk, and yeah.\nTONY: All the time. Yes. Even sometimes also during the day, when it takes a call, But then in the evening basically that time, social time, or just unwinding from work. Now Tuesday, the schedule is little different because I have to go -- be here on campus at 3 PM. And that day my sister picks up Mai, so that's good for me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Then I see her the next day, I pick her up, and the routine is the same.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So how late are your classes here?\nTONY: My class is actually only from 3:00 to 4:15 on every Tuesday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nTONY: Usual class.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then you get home back downtown around.\nTONY: Sometimes I'll sit here, and unwind for a little while, just sit back and unwind, that's been happening through, basically throughout since the course started, maybe 30 minutes or so, I might sit down, I might catch up on some calls, just looking at some, you know, going a briefcase and look at some things, but I was sitting up for a few minutes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay.\nTONY: Just a while, maybe 30 minutes, however. Then I'll go home, and it's kind of really just to have my batteries to be charged, so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, good idea.\nTONY: Okay, yeah, it's really.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you're at home like maybe 5:30 or 6:00 then?\nTONY: You could say that, yes. Because it depend on whether I cook a lamb stock and just something to eat or whatever. Okay?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then you said, Mai stays over night with her grandma?\nTONY: With my sister, my sister.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Your sister. Okay.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Overnight, with -- this is with Mary, right.\nTONY: That is correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, got it.\nTONY: Okay. Then Wednesday is typical work day starting at the 4:30 again. And I'm picking her up the same time as we did on Monday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Between the 3:00 and 3:30. So that's basically Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, those are all pretty much the same as Monday. Then Saturday as I told you, all of first four Saturdays of the month, then I'm doing it my hobby thing, and I have this thing to work home, some hobby. And that's from 9 to about 4'o clock.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: 9 to 4, and that's which Saturday of the month?\nTONY: Every Saturday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, every Saturday?\nTONY: Every Saturday, except for the fifth Saturday of the month.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, when there is one right?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: There isn't often a fifth Saturday. Is it?\nTONY: Fifth Saturday of the month comes on, nothing.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. What's that like every four months or something?\nTONY: Every three or four months that happens.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Okay.\nTONY: Every three or four months.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And that's your -- the project, the substance abuse program you are developing.\nTONY: Pretty much you can say that, yes, the others say that, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. And is that your school or your workplace?\nTONY: That's actually on the west side of Chicago.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that involves a bit of a drive then for you to?\nTONY: Not too much far of a drive, 45 minutes or so, not too much of a drive.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. You are really used to these long distances, aren't you?\nTONY: Well, it's really nothing for me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You traveled for me a lot today, but because it is 45 back, right?\nTONY: Yes, but if you consider when I worked at the prison at Sanford Correctional Center, I was driving 800 miles a week. I was driving a 160 miles a day round trip.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh. Wow.\nTONY: Yeah. But, I mean --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know, I know you --\nTONY: So these drives are nothing on me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You accept it, but on the other hand, I think it's a stressor too, you know, being in traffic and that's an hour and half.\nTONY: Only when the traffic is bad. You know, when it's bad, when it flows, it is really good. But when it is bad, and you're frustrated, you can't, there is no really other alternative far-out, that's when it could be kind of stressful. If it snows too bad, if it rains, if there is accident, which occasionally happens on these -- on my driveways, then it could be a stressor. But other than that it was pretty normal, I had it got pretty normal, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Okay. So I think you are so good at managing stress that you don't, you may not even recognize sometimes at these things, because you are used to. They do add, you know they're kind of a trickle effect.\nTONY: That's true. I agree. I don't know if managing and masking or managing is the word you might want to use. But I say the serenity prayer, and things I can change, I change some things, I can't change, I'm not going to worry about too much, that's how I am. And I've kind of got that pretty much down pat, whether if I do something about it, doing and if I can't, I think, I don't pretty much worry about.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: And then the wisdom to know the difference.\nTONY: Yes, that's very true. And then while you are going through the storm, I like that part, the serenity part that I go with the serenity. So even if something is going on, at least let me be kind of peaceful, so I can think of a solution instead of being all frustrated, then I'm all screwed up, especially if we can't do nothing about it, why be all frustrated.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right. Yeah.\nTONY: So, that's what I like about it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, me too.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Excellent. So, okay. So then Sundays.\nTONY: Sundays, I try to make it to church every, at least twice a month, I wanted to say every other, but at least twice a month, it is my commitment, even tell my significant other. So that we go to church together. So that's at least every other Sunday, if not, you know, but I put my two in, but I try for more, but normally it's two. And the other one is I just pretty much relax, when I can. Just be off schedule, so whatever.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you know, you just mentioned your significant other too, that's another factor in there, you spend time with that person too.\nTONY: Yes. Sometimes as on Tuesdays also. Sometimes it gives me time to do that on Tuesdays.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: After class you mean?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, that's right. Because, you don't have Mai.\nTONY: Sometimes, it gives me that Tuesday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Sometimes the Tuesday is involved and something Friday is involved.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Friday night and okay. Yeah. What was your reaction to mapping that all out?\nTONY: I figured that I don't have lot of time. I figured that I don't have time to add Ariel, but I did come up with alternative that would have to be the first or third weekend, the first or third weekend, and that would be because she is busy all the Saturday, and so I will be close where she is on Saturdays, so I'll be there to pick her up Saturday, and she come to the house, pick up Mai from my sisters, right. We all go to the house, spend time together, go out, whatever we're going to do, and then Sunday, that Sunday I have to bring her back to her practice which I think is -- I'm not sure, is that 1 o'clock or something. But, and I know there was not a lot of time between there, once I pick her up before or whatever.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you pick her up every other Saturday at four, or roughly little after four.\nTONY: Mai? Yeah, I could do that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No Ariel, and then you'd bring her home with you and stay all night at your place.\nTONY: Correct, correct, correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay. And then you would bring her back on Sunday morning.\nTONY: Right, to her practice. And like I say, her mom could pick her up or whatever.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And so when you do that, do you have to have that synched with the Sundays, you don't go to church.\nTONY: You know, that's one factor I hadn't added, because she is actually, they are Seventh-day Adventist, so they go to church on Saturday. But, well now that you added another one(ph) because I'd have to. I don't really think -- I don't think her -- and I'd love to have that happen. But I don't think, that her -- I don't think her mom will object to her going to another church.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nTONY: I don't think, I don't know. But I don't think, you know there might be different view, where we go on Saturday, we go on Saturday, you know and all that. She is not. Even though Mai is five, she ask a lot of questions, but then Ariel was almost eight, so I know she could ask a lot of questions.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And talk too.\nTONY: Very much. So, you just added another thing into that. But I don't think, she would object.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Which is something I may as well may have to clear it though.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And so or it is --\nTONY: But I think that probably honestly, truthfully, part of the time we would just stay at the house, at least initially.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That would be easier.\nTONY: It will be easier, and it would be more time. Even though has time together too but then more time, we could wake up, I can fix some pan cakes and eggs or other stuff and we could start talking.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It's more one-on-one time to, than it is if you are at church.\nTONY: Correct, correct. I agree.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Okay.\nTONY: That's true.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So is Ariel's mom is Nikki, is that right?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So is Nikki seeing it as to her advantage to have you take Ariel, gives her little free time or is she more sort of wanting to keep Ariel, like she is doing a favor.\nTONY: She is more wanting me to take her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nTONY: Yeah, certain times. Because yeah, and I told you at the last session about she was like when she has got all these doctors appointments this week when could you take her, da da da da. And I'm just going to focus on that part, even though it may be to her advantage even socially, I don't know. But it doesn't matter just give me time to spend with the child, that part doesn't bother me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is it Nikki that has other little kids at home too?\nTONY: Correct, two.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, little ones, right.\nTONY: No, she has a teenager, and she has a three year old.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: All right, okay. I remember the three year old, yes, but she can --\nTONY: She has a three year old.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: She can use the time, well that's works to your advantage then and that's good, she wants you to have, Ariel, good.\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Alright.\nTONY: So, that will work out, pretty good.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Whenever you are wanting to make a behavior change, I always encourage people to think about the obstacles and the facilitators, like okay. What are the things that could prevent you from carrying this out, and then after that it would be the things, what are the things that would counter those obstacles or work around them, and actually facilitate you doing this plan.\nTONY: Okay. So it can hurt me and help me, basically.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, Right.\nTONY: Well, well the helpful part would be that her mom is willing to work with me --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, that's true.\nTONY: That would be helpful part.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right.\nTONY: The obstacle would be her having these other -- the time constraints that would be the only.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Both Nikki and Ariel?\nTONY: No, the finer parts, it would be just a little time we spend together, and then she has got these other obligations before and after.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Before I pick her up, and then after, that would be the only thing. You know, she might be bonding and having a good time, or I have got to go to practice or whatever.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, I mean that's an obstacle to you developing a relationship with her, but I'm not even there yet, I'm just down the part of the plan like carrying out the schedule, obstacles to you doing your part which is the --\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

When I get sick, I actually get sick, whether it is a cold or whatever, I actually get sick, I did have this dry thing, I won't believe that doctors have kind of got that under control.

And I love my class, and I know they love me so. I really hate anybody else to for lack of a better word, fool my class when I'm not there, really, they miss me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, I believe it.\nTONY: They are like, how come you weren't here yesterday, where'd you at? I don't hate to play, I had the game, they give us time off, we have to take it, okay.

HAYS: Well, Mai you do have a lot on your play?\nTONY: You make me to look at it little more and something -- oh no that took a kind of good look, I'll be taking a good look at this, and I really figured out, honestly, I don't feel overwhelmed, but I feel how am I going to actually do this. This is really, seriously, because thereafter I get this thing with Ariel, then I got to add Roshan in there too.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I know.\nTONY: But I don't want to leave anybody else. So I don't know how I'm going to do it. I really don't know how I'm going to do, but you really got me more thinking about it, that this as -- you got me thinking how realistic it is, I mean. This is real, this is not something.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is this the hardest thing you've ever done. I was guessing, you would say no, okay. You've been through tougher than this.\nTONY: Oh, yeah, remember the yellow footprint?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yes, I was just going to say that, yeah. You have had many yellow footprints.\nTONY: The yellow footprints is -- motivation is another one. Yeah, I've been through tougher things.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So again you have, I remember saying this to you last time, you have that inner sense that you can, excuse me, you can get through this because you've been through worse right?\nTONY: Yes, this is going to take time, and some money, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So then I wonder this is kind of you ever do sort of solution focused questions in your work as a counselor.\nTONY: So, well, it might sort of but we are processing endo basically with the motivational interveiwing. I don't know if its the same, is it? Somewhat?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, maybe the thing I think of a solution focused is more asking people, okay, if you've been through harder than this, or something similar to this, what helped you in the past to get through it? And another question related to that that I thought of after -- when I was thinking about you after we met was I know your work is demanding. I'm sure it is.\nTONY: Yes, sure.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

psychological template based on the current psychological counseling dialogue:\nCurrent psychological counseling dialogue:\n```\nTONY: Wow, wow, okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you've been doing this how long?\nTONY: 15.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: 15?\nTONY: 15.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So you've figured this out, you know how to do this.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Pretty much.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So the question is how do you do that?\nTONY: Well, I have a saying, I was going to say truth sayings, one, it is not easy being cheesy. The other one is that's elementary, dear Watson, but. It just comes natural, for real, I don't know, just natural like all my life is people bringing stuff to me to solve, basically all my life seriously. And I tell them, look don't tell anybody, but look I'm going need the help with this or whatever I don't know. And it just seems that some will come, it's almost they come natural and I believe most of it is to do with the help of higher power because without that I couldn't do none of this, seriously. So those are my own strengths, I'd been tired a long time ago, and probably it would have followed in yoru footsteps in one year and like this and that for me, all these people bring me all these problems to solve. I got problems of my own if it had been I'm saying, but I have problem.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you really tap into your higher power, and your higher power helps you to kind of let go, is that a part of it there, that you know you do which you can do, the serenity prayer you do, you could do, and the other part you go, okay, you know, Tony, you're doing the best you can?\nTONY: I think that's what gives me the strength to do it because something as I had -- I mean to get through the day when some other things that people bring me honestly, truthfully, I mean, I'm about to lose my kids, (inaudible ). I mean, and some of them does the solutions, or even to come up and help them come up with a solution to the problem or a situation. Some things that I do or say, I don't really think they are of my own doing that I come up with, and it is kind of -- sometimes it comes quick, sometimes I have just sit back and think about it. But most of the time, because I say, I always tell them, I say, if you let me, then I'll take care you, but you've got let me so and trust me, then I will ask them, can I give you a suggestion here or there, but some of that stuff just seems to come natural.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you kind of open yourself up, you are kind of like a vessel, huh, it just come through you.\nTONY: Yeah, in some cases. Yeah. Seriously. That's really what happens.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you see that happening with this situation?\nTONY: This is -- it happen -- all happened for a reason. That's one thing what I work on having in mind is, it gives like, I'm standing while a little longer, and I got a purpose to stick around little longer. So that takes care of you. And I was hoping, and I'm hoping that other people who come and contact or help me with the situation, where they go, wow, because you know out of the clear blue this kind of happened with Mai or whatever, and with the other kids going so it kind of happens, so I'm hoping that they say well this is arbitrary too for me ) to just stick around a little longer, that's how I look at that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, this went really fast half-an-hour session, so we're almost out of time again, and do you see a next little step you could take towards this, remember the goal, you'd said originally was, excuse me, to be more accepting -- to adjust and be more accepting of being a dad to these kids, the noncustodial Ariel and (inaudible ).\nTONY: Yes, yes. My next step would be to call Nikki and tell her my plan, and then execute.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: We have more communication on holding it, the plan together. Because like, you see about, the one thing about the church, what she managed with the church, just to open that, just leave that open which she might. Because it is different, we go different church.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Just a communication of this is what I tentatively have plan for now, and then we will make it happen.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Alright/\nTONY: So communicating would be the next small step.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So the homework between now and when you are come back Monday, is that right?\nTONY: That could work, she has got a birthday party Sunday for her three-year-old. So hopefully we can talk.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is that realistic that you get a call before then?.\nTONY: I could call her and then she'll either say- I mean I could call, then she really say I'm super busy, call me another day or whatever, we can do my end(ph).\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. You will make the effort.\nTONY: Because her party is Sunday and it might be kind of busy up until then. And I don't really want to bother her then, so it might, it could happen Sunday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Is Sunday -- your Church Sunday or --\nTONY: Yes. So it could probably happen this Sunday. Sunday is her daughter's party also.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Not, Not Ariel's?\nTONY: Not, the three old. Maya, I think her name is Maya. Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So between now and Monday, then you will call her to see -- well to just tell her that you figured out your schedule and these are the times you think you could do.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: The every other Saturday.\nTONY: Correct. It will start off with one Saturday to be honest, five starts with one.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's good. That's realistic.\nTONY: Yeah. Five starts with one. But that was -- when I was saying, it tend to be confusing, but to say that, I have figured the first or third Saturday would be the Saturday we could do this, the first or the third, just to roll it off.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. That's good. Okay. All right.\nTONY: That's open and available, the second one no because Mai wouldn't actually be there, it wouldn't really work you know I'll pick her up Sunday. Yeah, first or third Saturday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, good. In a way you're kind of giving her a little choice there too between which one works better.\nTONY: And then we could switch up, give her little advance notice, see what's going on and then, make it happen.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Good, well that sounds like a good next step. And then we will take it from there when you are coming Monday.\nTONY: Sounds good.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Thanks Tony.\nTONY: All right, doctor.\n\n\n\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

So I got to candy from, it was time to turn into money, but my car was broke, we were trying to turn the money back and to her. So I asked her to come over to the house and pick up the money. And it was like -- I am like I never really, I should do anything, we need to work together instead of working separate. And we got a lot of flak about, you know, about that. Yeah, so - yeah. I think you understand that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Does she - do you think she was angry about something else or you like hit her the bad time --\nTONY: I don't know. I couldn't say, I just know it was projected at me, if it whatever it was. Whatever she was angry at.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: So I can't tell you what, you know, if anything else was going out with her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that's a kind of thing that can happen with the execution part.\nTONY: Pretty much, yeah. Like okay, maybe okay, I'll pick her up Saturday and then you pick her up Sunday. Let's say we planned it like that, then it probably be, it may work, it may not. I am expecting it hopefully will be, but it might well, no, you bring her back and then which may or may not be a problem, I haven't even figured that just it's kind of too much, except, I know, I am going to get her. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, you're going to pick her up at 4 '0' clock after her activities.\nTONY: Saturday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right, a week from Saturday.\nTONY: Correct, on Saturday, on a Saturday and then take her - her practice is at 1 '0' clock so then spend the night and then take her to the practice the next day at 1 '0' clock. I mean, that's the plan now, then, or I guess I can't take her back home. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So in that case, there isn't anything that's needed from her mom, right?\nTONY: No, not in that case. Not in that case.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah. So that's kind of how that went.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Well, good, you did your part then.\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did you -- was there something else you -- some other way you could have handled it or I mean --\nTONY: With her?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Oh, the other situation?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: No, actually this one, I mean this one was pretty smooth right.\nTONY: Pretty smooth yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, you both just agreed.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And your -- excuse me, you're doing all the work anyway right?\nTONY: Pretty much, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I mean, if you're picking her up and you're taking her back --\nTONY: Oh, yes, yes, yes, I am just anticipating, yeah, that's probably how it's going. I mean, what I think about the way it could go wrong --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well --\nTONY: In the future.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, on the other hand though, in some ways you wanted to plan, don't you?\nTONY: Correct, correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You mean to kind of plan ahead?\nTONY: Correct, correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Keep it from --\nTONY: Oh, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Happening.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, is that the next thing to kind of focus on, so what you want to focus on next?\nTONY: As far as that situation, because that's kind of -- you kind of get me from the small step to actually I am sure if there more time, then we will be - you will be even part of the execution plan. But you've got me from just nowhere to at least somewhere.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Right.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Well, you said that your goal is to be more accepting of and adjust better to these situations with Ariel and Rishad.\nTONY: Correct, I make this you know to my part.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, and so right, okay, so do you part and start to work on a plan with Ariel as the first step, and you've done that now. So what looks like a next step for you? Where would you go next with this?\nTONY: Building that relationship with Ariel is my next step. That's where I am looking to go.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you have to build, I mean, I realized you've had a relationship with her mom in the past and it's changed now.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But as part of building the relationship with Ariel, do you have to build a relationship with her mom too?\nTONY: Okay. That really confused, but slightly, but as far as us parenting the child?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, exactly.\nTONY: That's why you gone with this.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I don't mean like a romantic relationship.\nTONY: Correct. Okay, okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But, you know, you have your life, she has her life, but your parents and you want to re-engage with her, you want to re-engage more with Ariel and be more involved in her life.\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And she basically lives with her mom. So in order to do that, you're going to have to be in touch with Niki a lot more, co-ordinate a lot more with her.\nTONY: Okay, yeah. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, so it seems like the way -- one way to make that happen more easily is to have a good working relationship with her.\nTONY: Correct, correct. And I think during the course of the time of me picking Ariel up and this and that I'd say because just some time they just stop by, or you know, call or say, hey, I am in the neighborhood or whatever, I must stop by. Or we see or let's go to store or whatever. You know take her in my- but I think during the course of that relationship should be being built with her because we will be communicating more and you know co-coordinating. Yeah, I think in the course of that it should be, something that would be developing what I want to say.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did -- so, yeah, what I am asking you now is more about kind of process I know, you know these terms because you're a counselor, but sort of in the moment right now, is that something you want to focus on right now, like how to make that better or grow that relationship?\nTONY: It will be nice, I mean, if you could have some - you have points.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, I am thinking about things, but a lot of times what I am doing is more asking questions to get you to think about things because I think you know the stuff already, it's sort of more that, you know, when you say things sometimes it becomes clearer or you realize.\nTONY: That's true.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay, maybe this is the best way to go and this isn't or whatever, yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, I mean, sure, like I said again, by in the process of me spending more time with Ariel, that's going to -- and I am going to say this word, it's going to force us to come to develop relationship, right. Now, and hopefully, it's going to be a positive one, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I am actually not anticipating any obstacles in that part of your relationship with Ariel. I think just because you've described the relationship with Mai so well, and you know, I got to meet her after our last session and she is a doll, you know, she obviously is very bonded with you and --\nTONY: Oh, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know you're obviously a really good dad. So -- and you've had plenty of practice with your other four kids too.\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you know how to have a relationship with the kid.\nTONY: Yes. Need a little -- need a little refresher with coming from 32 to 3. Right, but I am thinking with her mom though I am saying. I am saying with her mom, and because of me picking up Ariel, that's what I meant to say, when of course, me picking her up, then it's going to force me having to have a relationship. Correct?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, you and Niki or you --\nTONY: I mean the mom, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, yeah, yeah.\nTONY: Yes, that's what I was saying.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I thought you were talking about Laurial.\nTONY: That's what I was --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, yeah.\nTONY: That's what I was saying --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, you know though, yeah, it will force the relationship, but not necessarily positive.\nTONY: That's what I - that's been what I just was saying, but I hopefully it's going to be a positive one.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right. So what I am thinking is, looking for ways you could increase the positive possibilities in this.\nTONY: Increase the positive.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Because I am assuming, you know, she is a single mom, right?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And she's got a teenager and an eight-year old and a three-year old.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And is she at home full time?\nTONY: She is at home. As far as I know, she is at home.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And there are --\nTONY: As far I know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, there are challenges in that. I mean, there are challenges if she is working outside the home, but there are also challenges if she's home all day with kids --\nTONY: I am thinking she is there all day because I haven't her mention anything else. So I know she said three was a handful, so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And does she have good family support or people around her, help her?\nTONY: Still mom and dad, her mom and dad pretty good support. I can't say of sisters and brothers because they all have busy lives too. So, you know, but as far as her mom and dad are concerned -- because and the mom is over there frequently at her house. So I got a pretty good rapport on her mother too and her father actually.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good, good. That kind of helps.\nTONY: Yeah, yeah. A pretty good rapport with her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So she has got a little bit of support and her mom come over to help positive relationship with her parents, but even if you have a lot of support, having three kids as a single parent is pretty hard.\nTONY: Okay. I buy that I don't -- I am with you.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: I see people with -- I like well, if I've got a multiple. If I had multiple now and I was single dad, how can I handle that?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, there you go, think if you have Mai plus a teenager plus a three-year old.\nTONY: I found out what it is to be a single mom, I mean, as being - from being a single dad, I find out what a single mom kind of goes through. And I said, wow, I see this and I see that now. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What kinds of things do you see that are really difficult challenges?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: If you're going to have this relationship with Ariel, you have to have a connection with her, a good connection.\nTONY: Very true.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Good connection with her.\nTONY: And that's true. I am like empathetic, but as far as let's say the situation happened with the candy. And I would just -- now as I think about it now, I could think, okay, does she have gas? Just the three year old driving her crazy or whatever, I could think about that now. But then I was more focused on this girl has to have her candy money in tomorrow. I don't have a car at the time, you have a car at a time, sacrifices have to be made. So you'd have to gather that, well, she got to -- she basically got, the teenager, the teenager is I think 16, so she basically could have left the kids and just came in got the money. Right, so I really couldn't see why this was so difficult to do that. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, and I can see why you would think that, that would be a reasonable thing to think. And then at the same time, how do you feel when you think that?\nTONY: I just feel that there was - she is not - wasn't been helpful.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, which actually that --\nTONY: It could have been helpful.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's a thought and the feeling, the feeling is --\nTONY: How did I feel?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: usually more like, one word like irritated or angry or disappointed, frustrated.\nTONY: Angry, I was angry.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, there you go.\nTONY: I was angry\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You were angry, yeah.\nTONY: Yes, I was. I was angry.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, that's a good example though of how -- what you're thinking can increase your anger too. So the more you think to yourself, what's up with this, you know, like, talk about selfish, here she is.\nTONY: Why?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: She has got a 16-year old, they've got a car, she could come, she could come, get it. I am really busy here, I got my own stuff going on, I already got the money. All she has to do --\nTONY: That's it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you feel angrier and angrier right?\nTONY: No, I just got one time angry. I didn't -- the anger didn't escalate.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Only in the moment.\nTONY: No, this is how just really I was --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Or was just the flash.\nTONY: I was really angry though about.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, in the moment.\nTONY: I was about seven --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Pretty angry, were you?\nTONY: Out of ten\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yea, bout' a seven.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, I found that one way to kind of counter that it's sort of that cognitive behavioral idea of kind of countering with the different thought that will help you manage the anger.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And apparently you were able to do this because you told me it was just the flash blood, just tell you this one way that I have people do it sometimes.\nTONY: Okay. Please, please, please.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is to use a different voice, I call it the compassion voice that helps you think more compassionately sort of generously towards the other person like coming up with generous interpretations of their behavior instead of the, the worst interpretation. The worst interpretation in this case is, she doesn't give a hoot about her kids, she is so selfish and blah, blah, blah, you know, which makes you angry.\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But if you -- now this is easy for me to do because I am sitting here kind of an objective outside the situation but I am thinking of, I am thinking of some pretty reasonable reasons that she couldn't like, okay, I am thinking she is a single mom, she's got a teenager, her teenager could be pouty today or her teenager could be somewhere else like it in a vantage school and her eight-year old, the eight-year old is on the way that was, you had Ariel right?\nTONY: I've just had the candy, but she had Ariel.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You had the - okay, Ariel has been all upset and angry and stuff and the three-year old sick with an ear infection and she is short on money and the landlord is banging on the door because she needs to pay the rent and she really doesn't want to use a little bit of money she has left for gas to get to the -- to get to you and you call her and say, I got to give you that money, you need to come here and get it now.\nTONY: Yeah, she takes me and say, we got to have about a mile. And I'd say that, I don't have a car, can you come and get it? Right.\nTONY: You know with some adjectives attached to.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So she is pretty stressed out and nasty about it.\nTONY: Yes.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: It's really more about managing your own emotion...\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Towards her, so that in the moment you don't because when somebody comes at you like that it's really hard not to snap back or say stuff that escalates it.\nTONY: Yeah. I just didn't even respond to her after she said that. And I think as I went back I think it was more texting than talking, yeah, it was more texting, I didn't even respond, she did call me couple of times, I didn't answer the phone because that wasn't going to solve the problem. What's going to solve the problem is, you telling me that you're going to get the money, not calling me to just add on to what you just texted me. So the best thing I will do, if you got to call and say, hey, I want to come and get it, I asked her so, so in order so, it would not escalate any further in my mind, it's best I don't communicate.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So you know to just kind of disconnect from her when she is doing that?\nTONY: Yeah, that's what I did.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, so --\nTONY: I am not going feed off in to her, I am just going, okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, but it's the time you are feeling pretty angry.\nTONY: I was angry.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, that's why you know you call her and then you want to call and then -- but what are you going to say, you're not going to say that you're going to come.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right.\nTONY: So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So how did you resolve it?\nTONY: We resolved it by the next day, actually I was close by her mother's house the next day and I don't know if she got it from mother, no, I don't know what happened. But the next day I dropped it off at her mother's house.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, you did?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nTONY: So I am thinking that, I am thinking that she might have gotten it from her mother, it wasn't told to me like this, but that's what I am thinking.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But you did go ahead and drive there then give it to her--\nTONY: Yeah, I got over there.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: It wasn't my car, but I got over there, yes, the next day. And I dropped her off in her mother's house.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you would let go off your anger by then?\nTONY: I didn't think about it anymore.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Because it was - that was just at a time, you need the money, but you won't go and get the money.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So how did you let go the anger?\nTONY: I'd see, if you remember, I didn't feed off in to it, when she texted me all this stuff like you know, you --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You blank blank.\nTONY: That's why I didn't want to fool with you. And this candy, da, da, da, da, da.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: She said that?\nTONY: Yes, and so, like this is not solving the problem in any kind of way. And I just, after that point, it was over, you can call, you can say whatever unless you got to - yes, you've got to take us, say, okay, I'm going to get the money. It was nothing else to talk about. So I mean I'm saying it didn't go any further than that in my mind. It didn't, you know --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you - so, internally you were just able to let go of it?\nTONY: Yes, over.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Yeah, over it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And it wasn't about pushing that down or --\nTONY: You know people say, they say you know, I don't care about things. They don't know whether you care about things, but I kind of (inaudible ) sweat about some things. So I just you know, want to see me sweat, even though I may be sweating, on the inside. But it won't, but anyway, that just went, that just -- it didn't even register long enough, like I said, it might have been the instant once you text that and say, will you not come and get it. I really felt kind of bad now that she wouldn't have the money in the morning, but there was actually really nothing that I could do. I could not, I had no transportation to get anywhere. So that's really -- so I really feel bad for Ariel, she couldn't have the money then. That cause she called the school or something and tell them she'll have it later, you know, some to that effect. So but then the next day, I dropped it off and I mean there was nothing filling the wires.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Well and I know that, that kind of flash of anger too in a moment like that is, you know, that's pretty normal. I wouldn't -- it's pretty hard to get rid of that feeling, it's kind of a normal reaction to somebody coming at you and being really nasty with that.\nTONY: Yeah, unhelpful.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. The idea of sort of changing what you think to change the way you feel is more about the emotion that hangs on and it becomes overwhelming or it leads you take action that is sort of self-defeating or you know works against you, but you didn't do that?\nTONY: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: It was serious, but wasn't that serious.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you pretty much know how to handle her when she gets upset?\nTONY: Pretty much.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Be quiet. That's my method, be quiet. I mean if there is something, I really stand firm on and think that it would change the situation, did I may say something, but did after, if that's not going away, I mean, why -- I'm not going to sit and get totally upset about it. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you just kind of disconnect from her in the moment?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And that works?\nTONY: It works pretty much.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then if you can do whatever she wants you do it and if you can't, you can't.\nTONY: That's what I meant. Right, nothing I could do.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay, well, that makes sense.\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Whenever somebody is, a person is wanting, including myself, wanting to make some behavior change or anticipating that they may need to do something different, which in your case it would be growing this relationship with Ariel and --\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: in turn her mom. Whenever you trying to do something new like that, I always look for two things, kind of facilitators and obstacles, did I mention this last time?\nTONY: I don't recall.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: This idea? That you look for things that can facilitate that change you're wanting.\nTONY: -- briefly, okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, and then what are the obstacles to that like --\nTONY: Right, we did talk to this one.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay.\nTONY: Right, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That and I'm wondering what kind of obstacles do you anticipate coming up with Ariel and her mom?\nTONY: Yeah, it does bring this. Right, right, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I mean the distance is...\nTONY: With her mom?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, the distance is an obvious one.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I don't mean what the relationship with Ariel --\nTONY: Correct, correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Just to interactions because you've got that down.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It's more with her mom in coordinating.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: That's alright.\nTONY: That's almost kind of slightly.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I'm not surprised, you're tired.\nTONY: I'm a lot tired today. It hit me all the way down here, I was like, well, you're little tired. But I don't see, I don't really, other than attitude, I don't really see anything else other than that, just wanted to have some attitude.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Her attitude or yours? Or both.\nTONY: Hers.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Hers. Okay.\nTONY: That's the only thing I could say being mad at me for some reason, which I don't know what that could be. But I'm just saying, and say, no you can't come get her -- or whatever. That's only the -- I could see lot of the plans change and I hope there is enough time in between for them to at least communicate with me that day. You know some came up and they've gone on a trip with the school or with the praise nasty(ph), whatever. You know whatever was going on. But other than that, I can't really see anything, you know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: That between me and her, there's an obstacle.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What about like, history, I mean triggers of history, because you had a relationship with her mom right for a while? Was it longing on or just like a pretty quick few days or pretty brief?\nTONY: No, it was - no, it lasted a little - last a little time. Year or two, I don't know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean I'm guessing that in a relationship, well, in any relationship where there is a kid, there is going to be some conflicts right, between the two of you?\nTONY: Yeah, but I don't, but as far as reflecting back on the relationships these instance, she has to got to marry, and so it's been, you know, I don't know, three, four, five years, I don't know, but she has been married at least three years I think or something to that affect, some where around or so. You know, and then we were broken up way before this. So there is no fillers, any relationship type fillers. So that could be a part of this plan.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You don't think she could be holding on to any anger or --\nTONY: For me?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: It wasn't, I don't even know how the heck we broke up, it was --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, I'm not suggesting that you did anything to warrant her anger, I am just saying when people break up--\nTONY: Yeah, but I mean, I couldn't play a part though, but I could play a part.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: I don't know, I think it was just something like that I don't know. Oh, yeah, I know, it was the - her, yeah, it's her older kid's father came back in the picture. And yes, something like, some to that effect, that's what had happened. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you mean that brought up some anger?\nTONY: That broke us up kinda sorta.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, well, that would, wouldn't it?\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Okay.\nTONY: Neither, I went my separate way and she went her's it was some time in there in the middle and somehow that's how you should get in there. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, yeah, and what I started to say, with any breakup, I mean whoever initiates it, very often there is anger in it, whether it's the person -- even if it's the person who initiated it.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know people get hurt, and that often turns into anger or they don't get what they wanted or disappointed in there --\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Agree about it. And -\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: From what you're saying, I'm guessing that anger is a reaction that she does have when she is stressed and --?\nTONY: Oh! Yes, she can be angry. Right\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So when we talk about obstacles, that's the one that popped in my head, was just if there is old stuff, she is hanging on to and her attitude that some old anger or something that you, that maybe something's that come up, I don't even know what would trigger that...\nTONY: Yeah, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know in her and she might get angry, but there is not much you can do about that?\nTONY: No, no, I don't think. No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Other than the strategy you used, which just disconnect for a little while and then --\nTONY: Yeah, I don't know,anythign worth arguing about then. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: So if it's like that then I'd just pay at will, kind of pay it no mind put some distance between the situation, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So then facilitators like, what -- are there any things that you can do or you can think, you know, like ways of thinking that can help you to make this relationship with her as positive as constructive as possible.\nTONY: Stick to my word --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: The same comments we gave, comments we gave. I think that would be one thing that could do it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Yeah, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then that's a good one and then, just as a backup to that, if there is something that happens that you really can't, like you get sick or --\nTONY: Oh, yeah. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Mai gets really sick and you don't want Ariel to get sick --\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: By being around Mai then -- then what?\nTONY: Communicate that to her as early as possible. So you know, she might have plans. Like sometimes like once or twice with Mai's grandmother. They didn't call, not even the last minute, you know, and I hate to tell Mai that she's going. And then she's not going, because she gets really upset, because she's already got in her mind, she's going. But as you would see the last minute when I get the call, oh! no you know, whatever. So, yeah, so that does work like- I can see how that can frustrate people because you know, you might, she might base that on, okay, he's going to have Ariel. My mom's got, what was the little baby's name, Maya, I think or something. Okay her mom has got Maya, maybe she's got plans, I don't know, you know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Her three year old, you mean --\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And the teenager is busy, and yeah, she make plans. So, yeah, I think that's a good one and --\nTONY: Yeah, as soon as possible.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Actually if you even add in a little apologetic tone to it too, like I am really sorry, you know, but --\nTONY: That just came up. I know\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay. So that's good.\nTONY: Emergency or something.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: That will be the one thing that really stops the two. An emergency situation because I'm actually you know going to sacrifice for a good and make that happen on that Saturday and then make it happen. Then maybe I can go to sleep and let the two girls play with the Barbie dream house.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: The Barbie dream house?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Because I can't get too much sleep. Some time I had to be a Barbie or to a doll or so. Seriously, happens, yeah. So, yeah, then I can, yeah --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that's another facilitators and it really, I mean, the Barbie dream house helps you do this, manage this, which -- and the more you can do this, the better.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: It sounds like, Ariel's' mom actually likes you to take Ariel.\nTONY: She's really - she's really one, I don't know what it is, but it's okay, it's good with me that, you know, we have this relationship rather than with the other, with the child where she is more willing, the other one is like, I don't know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: You know, as I am crazy, lunacy(ph) type stuff.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, that --\nTONY: And really helps out, it really helps the situation than hinders the situation. Yeah, there we go.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I would think she would appreciate you coming together, I mean, if she has got --\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: All this on her plate and other kids, you know.\nTONY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: I could say, I really - I think it help, it helps too that she is willing, you know, instead I having to beg or whatever to say, so to speak yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you know that might be another facilitator with her would be just to her that, you know, kind of that positive reinforcement idea.\nTONY: That I appreciate.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Some to that effect.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, just periodically say, you know, Niki I really appreciate that you're making this easy for me to get together with Ariel, I really appreciate it because you know --\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I love that little girl to death, that I really want to have the relationship and it really means some to me that you're helping us make that happen.\nTONY: Yeah, that sounds good.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Really does.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And also you're both putting Ariel's needs above your own, you know--\nTONY: Yeah, because its nothing personal even if I had something personal against Niki then I wouldn't you know, involve Ariel in that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right. Well, and the same for Niki, if she has any leftover, you know, irritation or anger, frustration with you at all, she sees that, it's good for Ariel to have a relationship with her dad.\nTONY: Right, because when I went and saw recently the hospital, she'd being dolled up she beemed up at me(ph) and then we went to play this connect for or something game. And we were walking down in the hospital and she had her IV, I don't know she is just so cool.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's nice --\nTONY: To walk to that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So it was Ariel that was in the hospital ha?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Not Niki. She -- did she have some chronic condition or--\nTONY: Cardiomyopathy and myopathy.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh! Really?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh my --\nTONY: Yes, so she is frequently, frequently she was going to hospital a lot. So, I suppose she was in (inaudible ), but now it's kind of in between somewhat, you know. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How does that affect her day to day --\nTONY: Lot of time, lota school kind kinda sorta, lot of time something outta school(ph) she has to take breathing treatments and stuff. So, and medication.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is her exercise limited, like her physical exercise?\nTONY: As far as I know, I really can't, obviously, I asked that question intelligently being around. But I know she does the praise dancing and she was in the gymnastics, so --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: -- you know, too limited.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: She just sort of get sick from time to time ha?\nTONY: Correct. And I think she got allergies kind of bad too. Yeah, because NIki says, she was in the hospital when she was younger with allergies. And I think I am pretty sure she told me that, yeah, so that with allergies too.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that's another piece too in terms of your empathy towards Niki is just not only did she have a teenager, an eight-year old and a three-year old as a single parent, because you said, she's not with -- you said, she got married, but they're not together anymore?\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Not at this time, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So she is single parent, a teenager eight-year old, three-year old and one of them the eight-year old, Ariel actually has chronic medical problems.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do the other ones?\nTONY: No. The other one is, some of the three-year old, I think is hyper or something.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, well that's another thing, then ha, she's dealing with.\nTONY: Yeah, she say, that's a handful right there, I mean, overactive than the normal three-year old, like it's --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: As in attention deficit disorder or something?\nTONY: That we might have to go see some, you know --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Seek help or something, that's the way she has made it to me. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And they're probably home with her, that's one is home with her all the time here?\nTONY: Correct, correct, correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, yeah.\nTONY: Right. And she has kind of a tragic past. Niki, herself and the teenage daughter, right, some things happen.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: She has had some pretty hard things in her life then ha?\nTONY: Yeah, somebody -- well, yeah, I'd tell you off.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: But yeah, some things happen --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you know when that's back to that kind of compassionate thinking about her --\nTONY: I just thought about that though.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, when you're thinking those things, can you feel kind of a shift in yourself to kind of more open towards her or sort of more forgiving of her?\nTONY: Now, I do, since I'm sitting here talking to you, because all the stuff had came up before. That was a spurt or moment thing, well, we need to do this and I need help, and can you help me? That's for the child, it's not for me, it's for the child. And so, I really wasn't thinking past that, it - I was just focused right on the situation. But now that I have sat here and you know, we're talking about a little bit and some other things have came up that, that could be someone with more, show some empathy now for her. But you know all this other stuff I'm thinking didn't have anything to do with this situation, I don't think. The money situation come in and get it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: All this other stuff, what?\nTONY: The stuff that we just talked about, the chronic medical problems and the three-year old, the handful --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh you don't?\nTONY: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, I see it, it's like she is super stressed, you know?\nTONY: That could be, that could be true, but we got a mission, we got to get the candy money --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right.\nTONY: For tomorrow.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. But --\nTONY: You're always going to be that stressed because those things aren't going away.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, you're good at putting things aside like that.\nTONY: My stress was not going anywhere and I --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Got rid of that, I did my part because I got welcome, they bring me the other box of candies we got it or whatever, you know, I welcome that. Despite all the things that I had got and didn't affect me, and if I had a car, I would have been owned and gave money.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: So, okay, well, we're about out of time, let me ask you, what do see as a little next step, like a homework thing, and we only got two days, so something that's really easy, but would feel like you're moving forward with this.\nTONY: I am thinking, thinking, thinking, thinking. I don't know. Other than just what you said earlier about basically stroking her and telling her, thanks for making this kind of easy on me. I appreciate it, making this easier on me, to be able to see my child.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Good.\nTONY: That's about what I say.\nPAMELA A.

Yeah.\nTONY: It was full early, I don't know if she cleared it up yet because (inaudible ) how I got her, other than she seeing, I made the call, as I had to text her after because I said her voice mail was full. So I ended up texting her, to call me, it's important. That's how she actually, you know, called me two or three hours later or so she called me.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So text or call?\nTONY: Yeah, I'll try to call first.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: And if that doesn't work too, I can type that, because sometimes when you read that, looks pretty cool.\nPAMELA A.

HAYS: That was 9 to 4, all right?\nTONY: Correct. Correct. Then actually it was my significant others birthday, so - well, her birthday was next Friday, but anyway so we went out and so that was kind of enjoyable. And then, let's say, I picked up my Sunday afternoon, early afternoon. And from there we went. We went to actually find my friend's house who has said, he's got a couple of horses. So we went out to find his house, but then the weather changed like quickly.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, yeah, it did.\nTONY: So he didn't make it up to, we found where it is, but he wasn't there because he said, the weather had changed, so bad. So he wasn't coming up to the house. So we just end up going home. So that's how mine was, then it was over.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, do you ride horses?\nTONY: Never have, but I was probably going to be tempted --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Think about it.\nTONY: Tempted to or thought about it, it was my term, I was going to have to ride first. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, she was with you.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay. Yeah\nTONY: Yeah, that was Sunday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay, yeah.\nTONY: Right, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, did you get a chance to do the homework?\nTONY: Actually I did, but it was quite -- it was few minutes ago, actually it was like 3:30.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's okay.\nTONY: So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, it wasn't that much time between the last time we met in this.\nTONY: True, and I called her, but she just got back with me, she actually got back with me earlier on my way here, but I was driving. And I didn't have a hands free or anything, so I didn't talk to her then. So I just got here a little bit earlier and then I talked to her just a little while ago as a matter of fact. All right. And I said the first Saturday in May...\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Because next week is the -- well, this week is Easter. And then the fourth Saturday, it's kind of a long day for me because I go to the methadone clinic first prior and work over there. And then I go on my project. So that's like a 13-hour day so to speak. Yeah, obviously is, I've done a so long analysis, goes pretty fast.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, so that's actually for your work place too?\nTONY: Yeah, got to work first.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: The methadone clinic part.\nTONY: My nine to five job, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. And that's on Saturday.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then you go to your project?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh my, yeah.

HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well --\nTONY: Sometimes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Most of the time, most of the time.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And the execution on both of your parts or --\nTONY: Pretty much, pretty much, pretty much. And that, you know, well, you know, I really ask her to do anything. Well, I just want to mention one-of thing. It was a time when, are we also the candy. So I got to candy from, it was time to turn into money, but my car was broke, we were trying to turn the money back and to her. So I asked her to come over to the house and pick up the money. And it was like -- I am like I never really, I should do anything, we need to work together instead of working separate. And we got a lot of flak about, you know, about that. Yeah, so - yeah. I think you understand that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Does she - do you think she was angry about something else or you like hit her the bad time --\nTONY: I don't know. I couldn't say, I just know it was projected at me, if it whatever it was. Whatever she was angry at.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: So I can't tell you what, you know, if anything else was going out with her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that's a kind of thing that can happen with the execution part.\nTONY: Pretty much, yeah. Like okay, maybe okay, I'll pick her up Saturday and then you pick her up Sunday. Let's say we planned it like that, then it probably be, it may work, it may not. I am expecting it hopefully will be, but it might well, no, you bring her back and then which may or may not be a problem, I haven't even figured that just it's kind of too much, except, I know, I am going to get her. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, you're going to pick her up at 4 '0' clock after her activities.\nTONY: Saturday.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right, a week from Saturday.\nTONY: Correct, on Saturday, on a Saturday and then take her - her practice is at 1 '0' clock so then spend the night and then take her to the practice the next day at 1 '0' clock. I mean, that's the plan now, then, or I guess I can't take her back home. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So in that case, there isn't anything that's needed from her mom, right?\nTONY: No, not in that case. Not in that case.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah. So that's kind of how that went.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Well, good, you did your part then.\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did you -- was there something else you -- some other way you could have handled it or I mean --\nTONY: With her?\nPAMELA A.

HAYS: Well, you said that your goal is to be more accepting of and adjust better to these situations with Ariel and Rishad.\nTONY: Correct, I make this you know to my part.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, and so right, okay, so do you part and start to work on a plan with Ariel as the first step, and you've done that now. So what looks like a next step for you? Where would you go next with this?\nTONY: Building that relationship with Ariel is my next step. That's where I am looking to go.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do you have to build, I mean, I realized you've had a relationship with her mom in the past and it's changed now.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But as part of building the relationship with Ariel, do you have to build a relationship with her mom too?\nTONY: Okay. That really confused, but slightly, but as far as us parenting the child?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, exactly.\nTONY: That's why you gone with this.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I don't mean like a romantic relationship.\nTONY: Correct. Okay, okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But, you know, you have your life, she has her life, but your parents and you want to re-engage with her, you want to re-engage more with Ariel and be more involved in her life.\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And she basically lives with her mom. So in order to do that, you're going to have to be in touch with Niki a lot more, co-ordinate a lot more with her.\nTONY: Okay, yeah. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, so it seems like the way -- one way to make that happen more easily is to have a good working relationship with her.\nTONY: Correct, correct. And I think during the course of the time of me picking Ariel up and this and that I'd say because just some time they just stop by, or you know, call or say, hey, I am in the neighborhood or whatever, I must stop by. Or we see or let's go to store or whatever. You know take her in my- but I think during the course of that relationship should be being built with her because we will be communicating more and you know co-coordinating. Yeah, I think in the course of that it should be, something that would be developing what I want to say.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Did -- so, yeah, what I am asking you now is more about kind of process I know, you know these terms because you're a counselor, but sort of in the moment right now, is that something you want to focus on right now, like how to make that better or grow that relationship?\nTONY: It will be nice, I mean, if you could have some - you have points.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, I am thinking about things, but a lot of times what I am doing is more asking questions to get you to think about things because I think you know the stuff already, it's sort of more that, you know, when you say things sometimes it becomes clearer or you realize.\nTONY: That's true.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay, maybe this is the best way to go and this isn't or whatever, yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, I mean, sure, like I said again, by in the process of me spending more time with Ariel, that's going to -- and I am going to say this word, it's going to force us to come to develop relationship, right. Now, and hopefully, it's going to be a positive one, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, I am actually not anticipating any obstacles in that part of your relationship with Ariel. I think just because you've described the relationship with Mai so well, and you know, I got to meet her after our last session and she is a doll, you know, she obviously is very bonded with you and --\nTONY: Oh, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know you're obviously a really good dad. So -- and you've had plenty of practice with your other four kids too.\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you know how to have a relationship with the kid.\nTONY: Yes. Need a little -- need a little refresher with coming from 32 to 3. Right, but I am thinking with her mom though I am saying. I am saying with her mom, and because of me picking up Ariel, that's what I meant to say, when of course, me picking her up, then it's going to force me having to have a relationship. Correct?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, you and Niki or you --\nTONY: I mean the mom, yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, yeah, yeah.\nTONY: Yes, that's what I was saying.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I thought you were talking about Laurial.\nTONY: That's what I was --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, yeah.\nTONY: That's what I was saying --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, you know though, yeah, it will force the relationship, but not necessarily positive.\nTONY: That's what I - that's been what I just was saying, but I hopefully it's going to be a positive one.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right. So what I am thinking is, looking for ways you could increase the positive possibilities in this.\nTONY: Increase the positive.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Because I am assuming, you know, she is a single mom, right?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And she's got a teenager and an eight-year old and a three-year old.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And is she at home full time?\nTONY: She is at home. As far as I know, she is at home.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And there are --\nTONY: As far I know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, there are challenges in that. I mean, there are challenges if she is working outside the home, but there are also challenges if she's home all day with kids --\nTONY: I am thinking she is there all day because I haven't her mention anything else. So I know she said three was a handful, so.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And does she have good family support or people around her, help her?\nTONY: Still mom and dad, her mom and dad pretty good support. I can't say of sisters and brothers because they all have busy lives too. So, you know, but as far as her mom and dad are concerned -- because and the mom is over there frequently at her house. So I got a pretty good rapport on her mother too and her father actually.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, good, good. That kind of helps.\nTONY: Yeah, yeah. A pretty good rapport with her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So she has got a little bit of support and her mom come over to help positive relationship with her parents, but even if you have a lot of support, having three kids as a single parent is pretty hard.\nTONY: Okay. I buy that I don't -- I am with you.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: I see people with -- I like well, if I've got a multiple. If I had multiple now and I was single dad, how can I handle that?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, there you go, think if you have Mai plus a teenager plus a three-year old.\nTONY: I found out what it is to be a single mom, I mean, as being - from being a single dad, I find out what a single mom kind of goes through. And I said, wow, I see this and I see that now. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What kinds of things do you see that are really difficult challenges?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Somebody even wakes up in the middle of the night and you're on, right. When they're sick or they have nightmare or whatever, even if you have to get up and do stuff in the morning.\nTONY: Yeah, because now I get two people dressed, myself and her.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: I see all of that, it's a challenge, but you get into the routine and then it kind of, it doesn't flow clearly all the time, or most of the time it flows pretty clear. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that experience with Mai has given you some empathy for her then what she's going through.\nTONY: I've never thought of. Thought of it like that, am I empathetic towards her. Sure, as far as I can say.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I probably should have said that as a question.\nTONY: Sure.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Could it? Could it give you more empathy for her?\nTONY: Sure, sure. Well, that's all I could to say, sure.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: When you're thinking from that more compassionate place kind of more empathetic place, how do you think about her? What thoughts pop in your head?\nTONY: I am sorry, okay. Look, this is obviously going to be -- I really haven't thought about it. You know, sympathy or empathy for, in that situation. It is what it is, I mean, well, I got my own things to go through with my own three because I got three too, basically it's just I only see one of them all the time. So I mean, I got my own set of stuff, I am going to deal with it right now then it be really kind of focused on what her other situation is to keep it forever with you.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And I am not -- I am not saying that this is -- that's not to negate your experience, I mean, your experience is very challenging, I mean I've --\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Said that too many times. I can't believe everything you have on your plate and you know you're in a position of having to choose between sometimes actually helping Mai and sleep yourself just to replenish your own stores you know.\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So -- but it's more about okay, I find with, you know, when there is a relationship that has a potential for conflict, the more sort of empathetic we can be about with the other person kind of compassionate in our thinking about that other person often kind of helps us stay more open and connected to them...\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you need a connection with her.\nTONY: True, true, true.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: If you're going to have this relationship with Ariel, you have to have a connection with her, a good connection.\nTONY: Very true.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Good connection with her.\nTONY: And that's true. I am like empathetic, but as far as let's say the situation happened with the candy. And I would just -- now as I think about it now, I could think, okay, does she have gas? Just the three year old driving her crazy or whatever, I could think about that now. But then I was more focused on this girl has to have her candy money in tomorrow. I don't have a car at the time, you have a car at a time, sacrifices have to be made. So you'd have to gather that, well, she got to -- she basically got, the teenager, the teenager is I think 16, so she basically could have left the kids and just came in got the money. Right, so I really couldn't see why this was so difficult to do that. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, and I can see why you would think that, that would be a reasonable thing to think. And then at the same time, how do you feel when you think that?\nTONY: I just feel that there was - she is not - wasn't been helpful.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, which actually that --\nTONY: It could have been helpful.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's a thought and the feeling, the feeling is --\nTONY: How did I feel?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: usually more like, one word like irritated or angry or disappointed, frustrated.\nTONY: Angry, I was angry.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, there you go.\nTONY: I was angry\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You were angry, yeah.\nTONY: Yes, I was. I was angry.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, that's a good example though of how -- what you're thinking can increase your anger too. So the more you think to yourself, what's up with this, you know, like, talk about selfish, here she is.\nTONY: Why?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: She has got a 16-year old, they've got a car, she could come, she could come, get it. I am really busy here, I got my own stuff going on, I already got the money. All she has to do --\nTONY: That's it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you feel angrier and angrier right?\nTONY: No, I just got one time angry. I didn't -- the anger didn't escalate.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Only in the moment.\nTONY: No, this is how just really I was --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Or was just the flash.\nTONY: I was really angry though about.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, in the moment.\nTONY: I was about seven --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Pretty angry, were you?\nTONY: Out of ten\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yea, bout' a seven.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, I found that one way to kind of counter that it's sort of that cognitive behavioral idea of kind of countering with the different thought that will help you manage the anger.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And apparently you were able to do this because you told me it was just the flash blood, just tell you this one way that I have people do it sometimes.\nTONY: Okay. Please, please, please.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is to use a different voice, I call it the compassion voice that helps you think more compassionately sort of generously towards the other person like coming up with generous interpretations of their behavior instead of the, the worst interpretation. The worst interpretation in this case is, she doesn't give a hoot about her kids, she is so selfish and blah, blah, blah, you know, which makes you angry.\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But if you -- now this is easy for me to do because I am sitting here kind of an objective outside the situation but I am thinking of, I am thinking of some pretty reasonable reasons that she couldn't like, okay, I am thinking she is a single mom, she's got a teenager, her teenager could be pouty today or her teenager could be somewhere else like it in a vantage school and her eight-year old, the eight-year old is on the way that was, you had Ariel right?\nTONY: I've just had the candy, but she had Ariel.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You had the - okay, Ariel has been all upset and angry and stuff and the three-year old sick with an ear infection and she is short on money and the landlord is banging on the door because she needs to pay the rent and she really doesn't want to use a little bit of money she has left for gas to get to the -- to get to you and you call her and say, I got to give you that money, you need to come here and get it now.\nTONY: Yeah, she takes me and say, we got to have about a mile. And I'd say that, I don't have a car, can you come and get it? Right.\nTONY: You know with some adjectives attached to.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So she is pretty stressed out and nasty about it.\nTONY: Yes.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: It's really more about managing your own emotion...\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Towards her, so that in the moment you don't because when somebody comes at you like that it's really hard not to snap back or say stuff that escalates it.\nTONY: Yeah. I just didn't even respond to her after she said that. And I think as I went back I think it was more texting than talking, yeah, it was more texting, I didn't even respond, she did call me couple of times, I didn't answer the phone because that wasn't going to solve the problem. What's going to solve the problem is, you telling me that you're going to get the money, not calling me to just add on to what you just texted me. So the best thing I will do, if you got to call and say, hey, I want to come and get it, I asked her so, so in order so, it would not escalate any further in my mind, it's best I don't communicate.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. So you know to just kind of disconnect from her when she is doing that?\nTONY: Yeah, that's what I did.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, so --\nTONY: I am not going feed off in to her, I am just going, okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, but it's the time you are feeling pretty angry.\nTONY: I was angry.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, that's why you know you call her and then you want to call and then -- but what are you going to say, you're not going to say that you're going to come.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right.\nTONY: So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So how did you resolve it?\nTONY: We resolved it by the next day, actually I was close by her mother's house the next day and I don't know if she got it from mother, no, I don't know what happened. But the next day I dropped it off at her mother's house.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, you did?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, okay.\nTONY: So I am thinking that, I am thinking that she might have gotten it from her mother, it wasn't told to me like this, but that's what I am thinking.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: But you did go ahead and drive there then give it to her--\nTONY: Yeah, I got over there.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: It wasn't my car, but I got over there, yes, the next day. And I dropped her off in her mother's house.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you would let go off your anger by then?\nTONY: I didn't think about it anymore.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Because it was - that was just at a time, you need the money, but you won't go and get the money.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So how did you let go the anger?\nTONY: I'd see, if you remember, I didn't feed off in to it, when she texted me all this stuff like you know, you --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You blank blank.\nTONY: That's why I didn't want to fool with you. And this candy, da, da, da, da, da.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: She said that?\nTONY: Yes, and so, like this is not solving the problem in any kind of way. And I just, after that point, it was over, you can call, you can say whatever unless you got to - yes, you've got to take us, say, okay, I'm going to get the money. It was nothing else to talk about. So I mean I'm saying it didn't go any further than that in my mind. It didn't, you know --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you - so, internally you were just able to let go of it?\nTONY: Yes, over.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Yeah, over it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And it wasn't about pushing that down or --\nTONY: You know people say, they say you know, I don't care about things. They don't know whether you care about things, but I kind of (inaudible ) sweat about some things. So I just you know, want to see me sweat, even though I may be sweating, on the inside. But it won't, but anyway, that just went, that just -- it didn't even register long enough, like I said, it might have been the instant once you text that and say, will you not come and get it. I really felt kind of bad now that she wouldn't have the money in the morning, but there was actually really nothing that I could do. I could not, I had no transportation to get anywhere. So that's really -- so I really feel bad for Ariel, she couldn't have the money then. That cause she called the school or something and tell them she'll have it later, you know, some to that effect. So but then the next day, I dropped it off and I mean there was nothing filling the wires.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay. Well and I know that, that kind of flash of anger too in a moment like that is, you know, that's pretty normal. I wouldn't -- it's pretty hard to get rid of that feeling, it's kind of a normal reaction to somebody coming at you and being really nasty with that.\nTONY: Yeah, unhelpful.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. The idea of sort of changing what you think to change the way you feel is more about the emotion that hangs on and it becomes overwhelming or it leads you take action that is sort of self-defeating or you know works against you, but you didn't do that?\nTONY: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: It was serious, but wasn't that serious.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you pretty much know how to handle her when she gets upset?\nTONY: Pretty much.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Be quiet. That's my method, be quiet. I mean if there is something, I really stand firm on and think that it would change the situation, did I may say something, but did after, if that's not going away, I mean, why -- I'm not going to sit and get totally upset about it. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you just kind of disconnect from her in the moment?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And that works?\nTONY: It works pretty much.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then if you can do whatever she wants you do it and if you can't, you can't.\nTONY: That's what I meant. Right, nothing I could do.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay, well, that makes sense.\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Whenever somebody is, a person is wanting, including myself, wanting to make some behavior change or anticipating that they may need to do something different, which in your case it would be growing this relationship with Ariel and --\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: in turn her mom. Whenever you trying to do something new like that, I always look for two things, kind of facilitators and obstacles, did I mention this last time?\nTONY: I don't recall.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: This idea? That you look for things that can facilitate that change you're wanting.\nTONY: -- briefly, okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, and then what are the obstacles to that like --\nTONY: Right, we did talk to this one.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay.\nTONY: Right, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That and I'm wondering what kind of obstacles do you anticipate coming up with Ariel and her mom?\nTONY: Yeah, it does bring this. Right, right, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I mean the distance is...\nTONY: With her mom?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, the distance is an obvious one.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I don't mean what the relationship with Ariel --\nTONY: Correct, correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Just to interactions because you've got that down.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: It's more with her mom in coordinating.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

You know some came up and they've gone on a trip with the school or with the praise nasty(ph), whatever. You know whatever was going on. But other than that, I can't really see anything, you know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: That between me and her, there's an obstacle.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: What about like, history, I mean triggers of history, because you had a relationship with her mom right for a while? Was it longing on or just like a pretty quick few days or pretty brief?\nTONY: No, it was - no, it lasted a little - last a little time. Year or two, I don't know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Okay. Well, I mean I'm guessing that in a relationship, well, in any relationship where there is a kid, there is going to be some conflicts right, between the two of you?\nTONY: Yeah, but I don't, but as far as reflecting back on the relationships these instance, she has to got to marry, and so it's been, you know, I don't know, three, four, five years, I don't know, but she has been married at least three years I think or something to that affect, some where around or so. You know, and then we were broken up way before this. So there is no fillers, any relationship type fillers. So that could be a part of this plan.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You don't think she could be holding on to any anger or --\nTONY: For me?\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: It wasn't, I don't even know how the heck we broke up, it was --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, I'm not suggesting that you did anything to warrant her anger, I am just saying when people break up--\nTONY: Yeah, but I mean, I couldn't play a part though, but I could play a part.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: I don't know, I think it was just something like that I don't know. Oh, yeah, I know, it was the - her, yeah, it's her older kid's father came back in the picture. And yes, something like, some to that effect, that's what had happened. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So you mean that brought up some anger?\nTONY: That broke us up kinda sorta.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, well, that would, wouldn't it?\nTONY: Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. Okay.\nTONY: Neither, I went my separate way and she went her's it was some time in there in the middle and somehow that's how you should get in there. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So, yeah, and what I started to say, with any breakup, I mean whoever initiates it, very often there is anger in it, whether it's the person -- even if it's the person who initiated it.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know people get hurt, and that often turns into anger or they don't get what they wanted or disappointed in there --\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Agree about it. And -\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: From what you're saying, I'm guessing that anger is a reaction that she does have when she is stressed and --?\nTONY: Oh! Yes, she can be angry. Right\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So when we talk about obstacles, that's the one that popped in my head, was just if there is old stuff, she is hanging on to and her attitude that some old anger or something that you, that maybe something's that come up, I don't even know what would trigger that...\nTONY: Yeah, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: You know in her and she might get angry, but there is not much you can do about that?\nTONY: No, no, I don't think. No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Other than the strategy you used, which just disconnect for a little while and then --\nTONY: Yeah, I don't know,anythign worth arguing about then. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: So if it's like that then I'd just pay at will, kind of pay it no mind put some distance between the situation, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So then facilitators like, what -- are there any things that you can do or you can think, you know, like ways of thinking that can help you to make this relationship with her as positive as constructive as possible.\nTONY: Stick to my word --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: The same comments we gave, comments we gave. I think that would be one thing that could do it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Yeah, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And then that's a good one and then, just as a backup to that, if there is something that happens that you really can't, like you get sick or --\nTONY: Oh, yeah. Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Mai gets really sick and you don't want Ariel to get sick --\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: By being around Mai then -- then what?\nTONY: Communicate that to her as early as possible. So you know, she might have plans. Like sometimes like once or twice with Mai's grandmother. They didn't call, not even the last minute, you know, and I hate to tell Mai that she's going. And then she's not going, because she gets really upset, because she's already got in her mind, she's going. But as you would see the last minute when I get the call, oh! no you know, whatever. So, yeah, so that does work like- I can see how that can frustrate people because you know, you might, she might base that on, okay, he's going to have Ariel. My mom's got, what was the little baby's name, Maya, I think or something. Okay her mom has got Maya, maybe she's got plans, I don't know, you know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Her three year old, you mean --\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And the teenager is busy, and yeah, she make plans. So, yeah, I think that's a good one and --\nTONY: Yeah, as soon as possible.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Actually if you even add in a little apologetic tone to it too, like I am really sorry, you know, but --\nTONY: That just came up. I know\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, okay. So that's good.\nTONY: Emergency or something.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: That will be the one thing that really stops the two. An emergency situation because I'm actually you know going to sacrifice for a good and make that happen on that Saturday and then make it happen. Then maybe I can go to sleep and let the two girls play with the Barbie dream house.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: The Barbie dream house?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Because I can't get too much sleep. Some time I had to be a Barbie or to a doll or so. Seriously, happens, yeah. So, yeah, then I can, yeah --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that's another facilitators and it really, I mean, the Barbie dream house helps you do this, manage this, which -- and the more you can do this, the better.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

HAYS: It sounds like, Ariel's' mom actually likes you to take Ariel.\nTONY: She's really - she's really one, I don't know what it is, but it's okay, it's good with me that, you know, we have this relationship rather than with the other, with the child where she is more willing, the other one is like, I don't know.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: You know, as I am crazy, lunacy(ph) type stuff.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, that --\nTONY: And really helps out, it really helps the situation than hinders the situation. Yeah, there we go.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I would think she would appreciate you coming together, I mean, if she has got --\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: All this on her plate and other kids, you know.\nTONY: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: I could say, I really - I think it help, it helps too that she is willing, you know, instead I having to beg or whatever to say, so to speak yeah.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you know that might be another facilitator with her would be just to her that, you know, kind of that positive reinforcement idea.\nTONY: That I appreciate.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Some to that effect.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, just periodically say, you know, Niki I really appreciate that you're making this easy for me to get together with Ariel, I really appreciate it because you know --\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: I love that little girl to death, that I really want to have the relationship and it really means some to me that you're helping us make that happen.\nTONY: Yeah, that sounds good.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Really does.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And also you're both putting Ariel's needs above your own, you know--\nTONY: Yeah, because its nothing personal even if I had something personal against Niki then I wouldn't you know, involve Ariel in that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right. Well, and the same for Niki, if she has any leftover, you know, irritation or anger, frustration with you at all, she sees that, it's good for Ariel to have a relationship with her dad.\nTONY: Right, because when I went and saw recently the hospital, she'd being dolled up she beemed up at me(ph) and then we went to play this connect for or something game. And we were walking down in the hospital and she had her IV, I don't know she is just so cool.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: That's nice --\nTONY: To walk to that.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So it was Ariel that was in the hospital ha?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Not Niki. She -- did she have some chronic condition or--\nTONY: Cardiomyopathy and myopathy.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh! Really?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh my --\nTONY: Yes, so she is frequently, frequently she was going to hospital a lot. So, I suppose she was in (inaudible ), but now it's kind of in between somewhat, you know. Right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: How does that affect her day to day --\nTONY: Lot of time, lota school kind kinda sorta, lot of time something outta school(ph) she has to take breathing treatments and stuff. So, and medication.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Is her exercise limited, like her physical exercise?\nTONY: As far as I know, I really can't, obviously, I asked that question intelligently being around. But I know she does the praise dancing and she was in the gymnastics, so --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: -- you know, too limited.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: She just sort of get sick from time to time ha?\nTONY: Correct. And I think she got allergies kind of bad too. Yeah, because NIki says, she was in the hospital when she was younger with allergies. And I think I am pretty sure she told me that, yeah, so that with allergies too.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: So that's another piece too in terms of your empathy towards Niki is just not only did she have a teenager, an eight-year old and a three-year old as a single parent, because you said, she's not with -- you said, she got married, but they're not together anymore?\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: Not at this time, right.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. So she is single parent, a teenager eight-year old, three-year old and one of them the eight-year old, Ariel actually has chronic medical problems.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Do the other ones?\nTONY: No. The other one is, some of the three-year old, I think is hyper or something.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay, well that's another thing, then ha, she's dealing with.\nTONY: Yeah, she say, that's a handful right there, I mean, overactive than the normal three-year old, like it's --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: As in attention deficit disorder or something?\nTONY: That we might have to go see some, you know --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Seek help or something, that's the way she has made it to me. So --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And they're probably home with her, that's one is home with her all the time here?\nTONY: Correct, correct, correct.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, yeah.\nTONY: Right. And she has kind of a tragic past. Niki, herself and the teenage daughter, right, some things happen.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: She has had some pretty hard things in her life then ha?\nTONY: Yeah, somebody -- well, yeah, I'd tell you off.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: But yeah, some things happen --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: And you know when that's back to that kind of compassionate thinking about her --\nTONY: I just thought about that though.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah, when you're thinking those things, can you feel kind of a shift in yourself to kind of more open towards her or sort of more forgiving of her?\nTONY: Now, I do, since I'm sitting here talking to you, because all the stuff had came up before. That was a spurt or moment thing, well, we need to do this and I need help, and can you help me? That's for the child, it's not for me, it's for the child. And so, I really wasn't thinking past that, it - I was just focused right on the situation. But now that I have sat here and you know, we're talking about a little bit and some other things have came up that, that could be someone with more, show some empathy now for her. But you know all this other stuff I'm thinking didn't have anything to do with this situation, I don't think. The money situation come in and get it.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: All this other stuff, what?\nTONY: The stuff that we just talked about, the chronic medical problems and the three-year old, the handful --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh you don't?\nTONY: No.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Oh, I see it, it's like she is super stressed, you know?\nTONY: That could be, that could be true, but we got a mission, we got to get the candy money --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Right.\nTONY: For tomorrow.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah. But --\nTONY: You're always going to be that stressed because those things aren't going away.\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Well, you're good at putting things aside like that.\nTONY: My stress was not going anywhere and I --\nPAMELA A. HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Got rid of that, I did my part because I got welcome, they bring me the other box of candies we got it or whatever, you know, I welcome that. Despite all the things that I had got and didn't affect me, and if I had a car, I would have been owned and gave money.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Yesterday I was involved in an accident.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: And that was pretty tragic and then let me -- I mean, I actually thought I was gonna be hurt in the accident because I slate on the express way, and then above stop one concrete barrier wall on that side to the other side. So, yeah, and after that I was thinking how blessed and lucky I am. I don't know what I want, but one or two, after that and it's kind of a life-changing experience, because that makes me think how much I really want to try to get, you know, something together. Because I thought I was -- I actually it was, I don't know how hurt I was going to be, but I had no -- I'm lucky to survive, that's what I do now.\nPAMELA HAYS: You didn't even have work pressure in that?\nTONY: For a little, I feel a little sour, but I'm hoping I'd be okay.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well. I'm impressed you made it here today, actually. If I don't know it happened, I wouldn't have expected you.\nTONY: It would have been transportation, because the car was gone, so.\nPAMELA HAYS: Totaled?\nTONY: Yes, pushed in so. Then I was lucky enough to get a rental car today, so I'm here.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: But I really want to finish this.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, okay.\nTONY: And I see that the higher power I want to be finished in this, too, because I'm here.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, were you able to do the homework?\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. Good, so what did you say to your --\nTONY: Told about the accident and then I told, you know, I see, I wanted to tell you something, and what I want to tell you is, I want to thank you for making this easy for me to want to try to establish this relationship with Ariel instead of making it hard on me, right. And then she said, what, I've always told you that I would never keep her from you and this and that. And, you know, we just got to talking about just generalization, but you know, how we could do this. And then I told about - -that I told about the candy.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, you did, you told her about our conversation?\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, interesting, okay.\nTONY: And that you were getting me to see another side of that. And she said, also you told of us, and I didn't tell I wasn't discussing your personal business, I just talk about the candy, because we were talking about something, the relationship with something, I just told you that, and she did say that she is staying with mom with three kids, and she don't know always have gas, money, and that's -- but you cursed me, in that process of telling me, you cursed me as he was like okay, she want to do a story about, I told you when I gave you the candy to sell that was totally my responsibility to get the candy, get the money, return the money, and that other step that happened between with the car and all that that's irrelevant, he was out of machine -- what you have to do, and now she said. But I told her I have a car, which was working just together, so that was the basis of that conversation.\nPAMELA HAYS: So you got it across to her that you were -- that I was suggesting to you that you think more from her perspective?\nTONY: Yeah, look at it from a different angle.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay, yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, that's from a different angle.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, do you think she understood that that's what you were trying to do?\nTONY: Then or now?\nPAMELA HAYS: On the phone with her, well, were you testing the phone.\nTONY: No, no, no. We actually had a conversation. Well, wait a minute, we guys can make this --\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, actually, yeah. I'm probably matching together three questions here. The first question is, were you able to, after you left her, because I know when you left her, you were like, nope, I'm not going there.\nTONY: Oh.\nPAMELA HAYS: Did you start to see it a little more from her perspective?\nTONY: I did, but as she was just going to just tell me that, because I said, but you -- you know, you cussed me, you said and you wanted to go and get it and that dispel anything else as far as you see and tell me you don't have a guess, you didn't tell me, so that just -- all you did was come out of --\nPAMELA HAYS: So when she told you that, that she explained she didn't have gas and she thought it was really clear, because she knew she couldn't come get it that did you start to feel more empathetic?\nTONY: I'm slightly more, yeah, slightly. That wasn't a big problem. If you just told me that, then I could have done that, but you came from another angle which made it, we think that, you know, you're attacking me.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: And you don't understand, I couldn't do it.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, actually she did attack you, but she was defensive, right, she was up to here and --\nTONY: Oh yeah. So that's my responsibility, that was all my responsibility. No matter what happened, that was my responsibility.\nPAMELA HAYS: How did the -- what was the feeling of the conversation when it ended?\nTONY: That's pretty good, because we spoke later, today also.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, good, okay.\nTONY: Right, right.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay, yeah.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA HAYS: So warm would you say? I mean, like a warm feeling?\nTONY: Yeah, I feel good, but we always -- like I say, we always can communicate pretty much, sometimes the conversation goes less if we talk too long, so it was actually a warm feeling, it was good feeling.\nPAMELA HAYS: Good, okay.\nTONY: It's pretty good feeling.\nPAMELA HAYS: Did you think any more about that later then, about that idea of sort of generously -- I actually sometimes call this a technique with people when I'm working with clients like the most -- I call it the most generous interruption technique.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA HAYS: When somebody does something hurtful to you that you -- and you're thinking about it, try to take the most generous interruption of their behavior, so, you know, the least generous incrustation of her behavior in that case would have been what, you know, which I mean she's -- you know, where she comes from, cursed me, you know, blah, blah, blah. The best kind of most generous interruption would be what I was suggesting to you that like, oh my gosh, she must be super stressed up to here with three kids -- child with a disability.\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA HAYS: The hyper, three-year-old, probably doesn't have money, because I know she is not working outside the home, not a lot of support that like.\nTONY: That's the most generous.\nPAMELA HAYS: I think, Unless can you.\nTONY: Gave her the benefit of the doubt basically.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. Can you think of a more generous one?\nTONY: No, like I said, of course, I gave her the benefit of the doubt, had she expressed the problem to me.\nPAMELA HAYS: Right.\nTONY: And that make her seem like okay, being part of the solution in that part of the problem.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

And I needed help.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: In that case.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, I know, it's very hard when --\nTONY: So, it was like, okay, I'm gonna -- even though I have not done that, i would try some anger management classes, but I wasn't thinking, I wasn't thinking our own techniques, so to speak, but I didn't go there, I think I didn't curse back.\nPAMELA HAYS: That's good, yeah.\nTONY: I didn't go there, I didn't let myself got upset. I like it is what it is and I left it alone that was it.\nPAMELA HAYS: Why you not kind of think of hoping as later, you know, it's like certain strategies work better than others, but then there are some that are even better than others.\nTONY: Correct, correct.\nPAMELA HAYS: So, you know, the lowest level is hitting someone and then, you know, it's better to walk out of the room before you hit somebody. But then on the other hand, that's -- there is some better than walking out of the room too, or hanging up, it's, you know, to stay to try and getting this non-defensive place and keep engaged with the person, if they can do that, I mean, now you got to be respectful of yourself too. I mean, you don't have to listen to being cursed out.\nTONY: Yeah, so I see that necessarily.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, but you don't want to get like, you know, from your anger management class if you start to do the yes but thing back and forth and defensive thing back and forth that just spiels around.\nTONY: Yeah, this is getting -- pour gasoline on.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, right\nTONY: I didn't even want to go there, I was like, it's okay, it is what it is and that's the end of that conversation, unless you tell me you come, and then if you not come, and then there's nothing else we can talk about.\nPAMELA HAYS: Right, yeah.\nTONY: So, and I don't see that, I don't see that happening. So I was like, just leave this alone so.\nPAMELA HAYS: So, you know, I want to go back to what you just said that about having this car accident really.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA HAYS: Put things into perspective or helped you get perspective? That wasn't my words.\nTONY: Well, obviously I have a new outlook on things this period as far as how now I want to do whatever I want to do, because I see this and I see that and this is what I was telling a lot of people and then put this in Instagram, Facebook and all of this, but you could be here in a minute and gone in a second and that's exactly what I got from there, because it started like a normal day and I didn't foresee anything, you know, I think what I'm going to do when I get to work and this and that, what I'm going to do after because I had class yesterday which I've got to make and all this good stuff, and the day was totally -- it was like, could have been over.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: For me.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, right.\nTONY: All right. So now I'm thinking I want to do basically whatever I'm thinking about doing or whatever I think I should be doing, that's exactly how I'm going forth with, okay?\nPAMELA HAYS: So does that open up some things in addition to anything that you've talked about here?\nTONY: As far as my children? With my children?\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, does it change anything or --\nTONY: No, it just got to make that better. It's going to make it better, you know, worse to better. I'm still trying to see how I'm going to deal with the other situation, because I actually sent a birthday card, I couldn't call to wish on his birthday, but I sent a birthday card, and then like I said, I got a text a while ago, I can't remember the exact timeframe, but a while back with pictures from -- of him, but there has been no more communication, even after I sent a card, there has been no more communication. So I dunno how that's working.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, that's a tough age even to call a three-years-old, they don't engage on the phone very much.\nTONY: Oh, yeah, you know.\nPAMELA HAYS: Does it really?\nTONY: What she does -- what she wish, let me talk, like I said, we spoke once every two weeks, a month, you know, it's been very sporadic. But yeah, we didn't tell -- it's my daddy or somebody, my dad said this or something she said or he said, you know, I have to say -- tell that to her or something, I don't know, right.\nPAMELA HAYS: So this really increased your commitment to reconnecting with him too?\nTONY: Oh, very much so, yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA HAYS: Did it put anything else in a different way that you're -- anything that you're doing or want to do or you also said should -- you think you should do?\nTONY: Well, I don't know. I saw my mother this morning and I always tell her this story, you know, she hugged me, but I told her I want those real mother hugs and her answer was, I don't care about getting wet, just hug me, and just tell everybody I love you, because I'm telling you that, go ahead and shoot me, shoot me up. I mean, when I eventually did get home, next time to my mother's house, because it was more convenient for me to kind of get around a little bit. When I finally eventually got able to get to car, saddle and got back home and all of that good stuff, I actually just sat in the house, it had to be a good three to four hours just with nothing on, just, you know, reflecting a little bit.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: That's all. So I see my life being somewhat different now, little more commitment here, and a little -- I love my class too, so I can imagine -- what they're gonna be saying like impact tomorrow, yeah, that's going to be quite interesting.\nPAMELA HAYS: What do you think they're gonna say?\nTONY: Someone will tell me they love me, someone will say that they miss me and then, you know, I got my own thing that I want to tell them, you know, about our life, I can switch up in a minute, just use some life stuff and how, you know, it is time to do whatever you think you want to do, because they could be gone in a minute. So things that I make sure are well prepared, something around that, but yeah, it's going to be pretty interesting.\nPAMELA HAYS: Emotional day?\nTONY: Yeah. So I'll be just as happy to see them as the old buddy will see me.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: So that would be good. That would be very good.\nPAMELA HAYS: And did you say, right, before you said that about work, there are some other things you're going to be doing differently or?\nTONY: Oh, I can't recall what I said to you, and I don't know what I said, that was about my work.\nPAMELA HAYS: No, before you said the work part.\nTONY: Before just --\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Well, I was talking about my mom.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, between your mom and the work part.\nTONY: Oh, I did. Can't recall that one.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

I didn't quite get it, I think it was something about --\nTONY: Switch gears quickly.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Okay, that's possible.\nPAMELA HAYS: I think it was something about that you could see things would be changing in your life, some things would change in your life.\nTONY: I don't want me I see now, like I said, it could be like this, it could be here and gone, I mean, yeah, everything is going to be just -- I might be not saying this correctly to where I want to say, but more commented to whatever, to do whatever now I want to do, because if I don't, I see how easy it could be over, because I didn't really -- that really -- you know, I was like wow.\nPAMELA HAYS: Do you hold some sort of core -- some values that are core to you maybe? Really that's kind of an abstract question to you -- for you to answer.\nTONY: Kind of solo. But being a good father, good parent, things of that nature. Being the best I can be as far as helping others get their life together for this one in the counseling, you know, feel, because I really -- I really, you know, I really wanna give my clients the best of me to help facilitate their change. So because of -- you know, to me it's like and I figured this out a little while ago, with all my class especially when -- I was used to be counselor in the nursing office(ph) and there is no but it kind of like -- it's like you have your own little following, so to speak. And you're the leader of this flock, pack, whatever -- however you want to call it, and they really put a lot of value in, in our relationship, so it was up to me, I think -- you know that for me to give them the best of me, this is what I'm saying, and I want to give them washed up treatment, I want to give them the best of me. So that's why I try to keep my life as much as intact to this, okay, even I've got problems and situations, I mean, I've got things too going on, but I won't take any of that to work. But just to give them the best.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, you really get that idea then -- that I talked about earlier in another session about how you have to take care of yourself in order to -- in order to give the best of yourself to other people, you could be there, but that's different from really being your best.\nTONY: Yes, I understand.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, just because I'm not together I can't give my best, right. That other -- I know you brought to light a lot of things going on, but when I'm at work, that's something work, right.\nPAMELA HAYS: You know, it occurred to me after our last session I was thinking about your situation and kind of this idea of adopting that was what you came in for help with, you know, to kind of adapt to your parenting situation of the kids that are non-custodial that you don't have living with you.\nTONY: Yes.\nPAMELA HAYS: I was thinking about this friend of mine, who -- she works full-time in a similar kind of position, she works with refugees and it's pretty demanding and getting people resettled. And she has kids and she's married, but her husband has gone a lot, and she told me about this. And then she has a faith too, so she -- that's another piece of her life and she told me about this book she had just read and it had the title something like a perfect balance or something like that, and she said the reason she loved this book was because she felt like she was just pulled in so many directions all the time, and she picked up this book, in the very first part of it, the author said; first of all, the first thing I want to say is there is no such thing as a perfect balance.\nTONY: I agree.\nPAMELA HAYS: You're never gonna get it. So give that one up, that -- basically just set your priorities like think about what you value and now I'm kind of adding my own thing here, but kind of think about what you value in life, what's the most important, what are the most important things to you and prioritize those, kind of hold those in your head every day, but keep in mind, you may do some of that in this today; and then some of it here tomorrow, you know, what I'm -- the example I'm thinking of with regard to your life is, well, you have a strong drive to contribute to make a difference in the world, to help other people, give them your best. That one day you may do that at work and then the next day you're not able to do that as much work, because you just did it with one of your adult kids at night -- till midnight talking with them on the phone about something they're going through.\nTONY: Okay.\nPAMELA HAYS: But when you were with them, you did it with them, you gave them your best, and be yourself up about not doing that in all domains, all the time, because it's impossible.\nTONY: True, very true.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: It makes a lot of sense. Yeah, I can see that. Doing what you can for that day, basically in the area that is called to be done pretty much so.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, I can see that, that's kind of someone operate.\nPAMELA HAYS: Do you already?\nTONY: Kind of someone asked, someone operate, it's kind of like, you know, holidays to family, this was kind of before I got my Todo(ph) but family would like to say, is to -- I look forward to holidays for rest period, they look for holidays for family time, so I'm like and I say --\nPAMELA HAYS: Kind of celebration.\nTONY: It's the holidays, you're supposed to be jolly and happy and there is no. But I'm tired, I just wanted to stay home and relax. And sometimes that happens, I'll come late or something, or I leave early, you know. And it's kind of like that, I do what I can and then what I can, I can't because I'm basically tired.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: So, similar, they're similar.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, yeah. That's the idea.\nTONY: But normally other people get kind of been out of shape during that, that's what happens, make you feel guilty or you didn't call me today. Well, I had a rough day at work or sometimes give me a call at work, and they don't understand I can't always talk to them at work, because I never noted, the door is closed, there is the client so and so, this is that, that's that and especially doctor days are hectic, and they say, you, you didn't sort of follow, you got a call late back, or some to that effect, but it is not always possible at that moment to do that. And then I'll say other people always kind of get better on the shape when, I guess if they have been neglected on these or being met when they wanted to be met, but did again they have to start looking as you wanted me to look at Nikki's life, or what she has started looking at, the other because this is actually the Africans want me and I have many other things gone.

They're all live in other state.\nPAMELA HAYS: All four of them?\nTONY: All four are in other state.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, okay.\nTONY: Then we were saying each other twice a year, last time I saw them earlier this year is January, my older son no, well, we haven't physically seen each other, we talk a lot, but we haven't physically seen each other. So yeah, sometimes I feel kind of guilty about that, I do the best I can.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: That's what I could say.\nPAMELA HAYS: Are you on Facebook with all of them?\nTONY: Yeah, we're on Facebook. Its hopefully a young family, we are on Facebook, Chris is the eldest boy, he is on Facebook. We don't really talk a lot on Facebook, we don't talk off. No, we might text and talk on the phone.\nPAMELA HAYS: Do you check at though for news about them and they do for you or?\nTONY: They are going to call me if there is something, or send me a text if there is something more. I mean I use it for entertainment, so I really don't -- I don't put all of those stuff on people, it's an entertainment to me so.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, how did they find out about the car accident?\nTONY: Oh, I text each one of them. I have them all on this mass text, and I text each one of them and I told them as I was bounced in the back of four of these concrete walls. I thought about how life could be here for a minute and gone in a second, and I just wanted to tell I love you.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, well.\nTONY: That's how that happened. Then my elder son actually called me, the youngest son text me. My daughter text, I haven't heard from my youngest daughter yet, but she just had anniversary a matter-of-fact today before their 10th wedding anniversary, so then tell about the accident. So they were out to dinner on that -- I won't say 14. Yeah, the 14.\nPAMELA HAYS: Monday?\nTONY: Yeah, they were out to dinner, her and her husband and her kids were out to dinner. And my son-in-law, my sister, I mean my sister, her sister.\nPAMELA HAYS: So you texted your two middle kids then?\nTONY: I text all four there.\nPAMELA HAYS: All four, okay. But you just heard back--\nTONY: All four. But it's all the responses I get. My older son actually physically call me. He called me after that. Man, I heard about your accident dad, like just you need my truck, come get it, daddy I love you, like the stuff. That' why I like conversation with.\nPAMELA HAYS: So you do that kind of keep your -- that I was describing that balance thing that you don't, oh, I know I was asking you about do you blame yourself?\nTONY: Correct.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, and you said, well, you do sometimes you feel kind of guilty.\nTONY: Sometimes I do. I know I didn't see even with them and they all with the-- I do sense that jealousy things, I guess I'm calling it right I dunno if- I think I'm calling it right or something there is something going on with the elder ones, with the young ones. But I tell them when you were young, I did the same thing for you. But I think it's like I don't know I've found that's something they need you just as much when they are grown, and they need when they're younger too. So, you know, but I tell them that, was it same thing I'm doing for them. This young one was here. The same thing I did for you. But I still think they feel someway neglected I believe that this for you.\nPAMELA HAYS: Do you feel really loved by your kid, all your four kids?\nTONY: Yep, I feel really loved by them. Yeah, I really do. I mean each of them there(inaudible ), yeah, all of them. So, I have a little connection problem with the youngest one Chris, because his mother kind of -- I don't know because we've divorced, so his mother kind of feel this head up, but this is I don't know what, but something.\nPAMELA HAYS: And he was the younger kid.\nTONY: So it's harder to connect, but the other one is good there, well, Kiana was -- she was kind of vaguely, Isha(ph) which is the eldest girl and (inaudible ) actually there, so you can't tell them nothing about daddy. Because they don't know the daddy for what it was and whatever. So you can't thank their mind, because they were actually there involved, they are well enough to understand. And Isha when she was like my there -- born when she was born from that age like me and Mia together now got this one, because she was only one for me, it was the same way. It was the same, so you can't tell her nothing about her father.\nPAMELA HAYS: So it's Isha, Kiana and who is the third one?\nTONY: Isha, Anthony Junior Kiana and then Christopher.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, alright. Anthony -- yes, so those three. The three though Isha, Anthony Junior and Kiana, you do feel very loved by them. Christopher is little more conflictual relationship.\nTONY: Yeah, we have rare moments.\nPAMELA HAYS: So do you think that the three elder ones, do you think they are angry at you, even though they love you like that they're angry at you that you -- after you got, that you and their mom got divorced that you got involved with these other women and had these other kids.\nTONY: Sometimes I feel like that.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, like maybe they had an idea of what their dad should be doing, and it wasn't get involved with other women and having other families.\nTONY: I kind of think that sometimes, yes.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. And do you think that yourself too, like do you blame yourself about that?\nTONY: I really don't know, because I have a life too, but I mean, I was still their father even though we got divorced. So, but my elder son, he told me, Anthony, he told me he thought he was in Florida early this year that he thought he -- what did he say -- he thought about his life would have been if me and his mom was still together, that's what he told me.\nPAMELA HAYS: And what did he say, what it would be like?\nTONY: We didn't go into detail, but he said, yeah, it was given me some kind of knowledge I can't -- he didn't exactly lead us, but he told me things about that and things about now oh, then, but he did tell me that, but I just can guess that somehow he thinks it could have been better. He didn't tell me that, but I'm fearing that.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Because he told me that we will talk about something, so some sound here -- song or something he was singing the song. Yeah, he told me that.\nPAMELA HAYS: So you blame yourself a little bit sometimes about that too?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

We grow together from six-years-old, we've been knowing to each other we lived right next door to each other, so we actually grew up together, so still we were friends, then we have the kids when we were very good friends, the kids together, but we tried marriage, it didn't work and that's, you know, that's just another whole chapter of something that -- you know, okay, you forget about that, we still have relationship, we got the kids, we got the grand kids and we're still friends.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, the reason -- the reason I'm asking about this is, to kindly get at that difference between the thinking about yourself in a way that's just figuring out what your parting -- what your parting problems was, you know, like in that relationship like what your parting was, and then also the relationships with the other women, with Ariel's mom and Mai's mom and Rishad's mom; and sort of figuring out, okay, what was your part in this, that's a constructive way to think, right, where you're holding yourself accountable, you know, you're saying okay, yeah, if I had to do it over, this is what I do differently, so this is a lesson I've learnt from it, so next time I'm not going to repeat this and this. But that's different from blaming yourself in a way that hammers in the guilt so much. You know, I mean, this first way brings up some guilt. But, some guilt I see is, it's helpful because it cause our attention to something that we have to look at and maybe do something about, make amends with somebody or do something different in ourselves. But when you hammer in the guilt with soft talk like, oh, I'm such a loser, why do I keep -- why do I even keep trying, you know, there is no point, blah, blah, blah, blah, that kind of stuff. That actually pulls you down so far that you can't make a ammends, you can't move forward and do your best or be your best, you know. So that's why I'm asking about do you -- I'm guessing you do the first, but do you also do some of the second, the self-blaming that pulls you down, where you can get stuck in it.\nTONY: Hmmm. Some of the things I don't think it was my fault, because I might have contributed to Dorothy, I admit that. The other was, I think -- I Nikki's mom, I mean, Ariel's mom. No, I don't even know how we broke up. I can't say with that now with Rishard, did I contribute tot hat well, possibility I could have contributed to it as far as her end, but I don't know, actually trying to make that work, yeah. Actually they try to make that work and we were just, I guess, maybe I have been single too long and she had been single too long, because this is kind of hard, some of these independent women, single independent women who has raised these children and stuff, I think it may be hard for them too get into a relationship and then have a man, you know, not one to -- this is like a better word, boss him around, but kind of like this builds something together somewhat and then this is how I -- this is, you know, some things that I see we can do.\nPAMELA HAYS: Kind of compromise one.\nTONY: That's kind of hard I think for some of them to get into and not be single pretty much a long time, I mean, marriage with Dorothy was forced, but I've been pretty much a bachelor for a while, sometimes said in my own ways and they've kind of said in their own ways, so that's how we're gonna meet the middle is, I think the major problem. I won't say it's a situation, but that's a major problem. It was a situation, but let's try to work it out, then became a problem, right.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: So in that case, I could have had played some part in that, right.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, and again, this is -- looking at your parting things or how these relationships went or -- yeah, what relationships you've got involved in, the point of it is not to be yourself up about. The point of it is just to figure out what you can learn from it, so that you can repeat the parts that worked and not repeat the parts that didn't work. And avoid this other thing of pulling yourself down with so much guilt that you are stuck in and don't -- can't move forward or do what you want to do.\nTONY: I think okay, then I'm gonna add a piece to this. Because if you look at my resume, you'll see my resume, I want to -- I switch jobs about every three to four years. But I get bored. So then I want another challenge.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: So if you see my resume, you see relationships, I don't know, there is something there that needs some help with.\nPAMELA HAYS: Jobs and women, okay.\nTONY: If you look at that, what you'll see is similarity.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, we only have one session left, Tony.\nTONY: That's what I need.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: I don't know if you want it. You know, I really feel like I'm bonding with you because I'm starting to share, I replay these things still on my head, trust me, and I replayed them on the last session. You know, I was kind of humor, but I was actually tired that day. But I say, you know what, these four sessions, I'm kind of bonding with Pam. What's(ph) in my head what I want to share more with you and so -- you know, I'm relaxing more and I'm feeling more and as I said, really wanted to do this, because I really want to come out with some solution or something -- I want something, I want the benefit from the sessions too. That's why I've really subjected myself also to.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, that particular insight that you get bored with people and jobs. You just get bored periodically -- yeah, your hear high level of intellectual stimulation and yeah.\nTONY: Yeah, it's always in the same field, because some guy told me -- I went to an interview and he said, you know, I'm looking at your resume, it looks like you're a job hopper. And I said, no, I'm not a job hopper, just I'm looking for new challenges. So they've been in the same subject and field, but different treatment modalities.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, you just wanted to grow.\nTONY: Pretty much grow and then as -- when the opportunity present itself, this is life, you're supposed to take advantages of these opportunities that comes, just feeling it to me, wanted to share this.\nPAMELA HAYS: So this insight you just had now, did you have that before and you're just telling me now?\nTONY: Which one?\nPAMELA HAYS: The one about oh, I do that with relationships too.\nTONY: No, I've been doing this.\nPAMELA HAYS: I mean, you've been aware of this?\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: You just haven't shared it with me.\nTONY: Oh, no.\nPAMELA HAYS: Oh, okay.\nTONY: Just I shared with you. No, I've been aware of this.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: Oh, yeah.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

I see some things. Yeah, I see -- I got to see this coming up.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, okay.\nTONY: It's been came up with the employment ad, just tell you that. Oh, yeah.\nPAMELA HAYS: Well, I mean, it seems to me that would be a smart thing for you to do, if you know this about yourself that you just be cautious in, particularly in relationships, I don't know with jobs, three to four years these days doesn't seem like that. It didn't seem like job hopping to me, because --\nTONY: Okay. Yeah, I guess he looked at the resume, two years, okay. I don't know, that's just what he asked me, so I had to explain it to him. You said, that's really -- but once I explained it to him, then he got a different outlook on it once I told this, same for your modality and just challenge, back then he's like oh well, that's good or whatever you say.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. But if you know this about yourself with relationships too, that would be something to just kind of keep in your awareness in your current relationship that do you know like oh, we don't -- I know we don't have time to go into this now. So I'll just mention it, sort of questions that we got, right.\nTONY: Okay, okay.\nPAMELA HAYS: Just kind of do you notice what the feeling, the experience, maybe in physical experience of boredom feels like. So do you notice when it starts to --\nTONY: Well, see, I use boredom in the job situation, the relationship could be a whole another -- something else within that. But there is some correlation, there is some correlation with those too.\nPAMELA HAYS: Right.\nTONY: Because both of them involve a personal commitment.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah.\nTONY: The employment and the relationship, right. And so, but I'm -- there is some -- I don't know exactly what it is. But there is something.\nPAMELA HAYS: So if you start to become more aware of what that started to feel like that before you actually act on it, you know, the boredom experience feels like, then you could think through what you're doing maybe more deliberately than if you fall into a disagreement or an argument or a conflict, whether it's work or the relationship, that leads you to think, I really need to leave this, you know, whichever it is, work or relationship, so.\nTONY: Yeah, I have to get out a little. I have to get out of something.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, just think about it.\nTONY: Yeah, some thought though about what it is or what comes up, what are the signs I guess I see coming or so.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. So do you see a next step for homework, keeping in your mind next time is our last time.\nTONY: Well, we kind of got Nikki's(ph) to cover. I should text Vishan to the number that she texted me the pictures from today. And I was told to get the car(ph) did they get the car, so I'm not gonna -- I don't think nah, I don't think I'm gonan call, well, I might try to call her number.\nPAMELA HAYS: Who will meet you again. Oh, Vishan. Oh, okay, all right.\nTONY: I'm just going to call the number that I got text and see what happens.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: That's what I'm gonna do on that situation.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, all right. Just take a step towards that.\nTONY: And I'm gonna give a little thought, I'm gonna give some thought to this correlation between this and that, but I'm really need - might need your help on that one.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah. And, you know, we're not gonna solve that -- the next time you come. But it's just, we might move you further along in your thinking about it.\nTONY: Yeah. Maybe then if I have something, I don't know.\nPAMELA HAYS: Yeah, yeah. Okay. So homework can only help people to one thing, so we'll stick with the calling Rishad's mom and then we'll -- yeah, so if you do the other two, that's great.\nTONY: Okay. Yeah, let's take -- I'll try to make that -- I will make that call.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay, all right.\nTONY: See what happens.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay. Well, see you Friday.\nTONY: Yes, ma'am.\nPAMELA HAYS: Okay.\nTONY: All right. See you then.\n\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",
