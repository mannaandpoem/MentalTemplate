Ah, so tonight is our fifth session and I know before we came on air you said that, that this is gonna have to our final one.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, so that sort of changes my plan what I'd hope we'll do tonight to be look at the homework you had done. Uhm, you know, talk about what you'd learn in sort of in a ways to extend this and then remember the last time we just talking of the three questions to look at negative answer to address negative thoughts, talk about that third question. Uhm, and then, next time I was hoping we could talk about sort of the future and you know, challenges for the future and do some planning. So we have to kind of push all that into one session tonight so that, uhm, I, I know you have homework. I could see it here.\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So I think we do wanna spend some time on that.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uhm, anything happen in the last couple of weeks since I've seen you, that’s sort of been important that we should talk about?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, we talked about my job, right?\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Yeah, you, you mention you're starting, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Start in my job.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, that's been busy. Uhm, work my first full week last week, this is the second week and its only gonna get busier.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: And, uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: Like, like good busy or it's just...\nYOLANDA: I'm not sure about the good part.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, okay.\nYOLANDA: Ah, I'm anticipating that it-- it's gonna be stressful.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: And, ah, I just wanna maintain my peace.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: in it-- while I'm there. So...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So would it be helpful to talk a little bit tonight about that idea about -\nYOLANDA: Sure.\nKEITH DOBSON: - trying to maintain the peace?\nYOLANDA: Definitely is.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, So I'd like to get to this, like I say, I'd like to talk a little bit about that third question, ah, and in terms of addressing negative thoughts, uhm, cuz that's really more of the big picture and, and sort of long-term.\nYOLANDA: Refresh from memory about the, oh the, the third-- got it.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. We’ll go through it, yeah, all the way down at the bottom of that sheet-- yeah, exactly. Uhm, and then what I'd like to do I think if it's okay spend a bit of time maybe in fact, like a third of our time or more talking about things you can do for the future.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, you know, to keep yourself healthy and to keep yourself, ah, functioning well.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay?\nYOLANDA: Good.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, so why don't we start here if we can, if that's okay with you?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: And talk about the job and then move to the bigger picture.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Is that OK?\nYOLANDA: Okay. Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. And anything else with or would that be okay?\nYOLANDA: Ah, it's okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: I mean-- I can't think of anything else that's going on. So...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. And my sense is that generally you're doing okay, you're feeling?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Just trying to keep up, ah, working now and going school, uhm, -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - just trying to adjust.\nKEITH DOBSON: You're taking two courses?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Three? Two courses? Yeah. And then, you've got everything at home?\nYOLANDA: Which is not, not much. I'm not married. Don't have kids.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: So that's not a big deal but, uhm, I went from having my days wide open now to being employed and having to rush to school -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - you know, I'm so much rush to get to school twice a week at night.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, yeah.\nYOLANDA: So, and then, basically the weekends are gonna belong school too.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: You see, so.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, yeah. It was basically squeeze at that time, right? Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: So where do you find yourself, right? Yeah?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I have -\nKEITH DOBSON: That, that would be one of the challenges.\nYOLANDA: - really try to think about it too much cuz it’s probably a-- distant memory.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Well, well, let's talk a bit about that tonight I think if we can.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, so let's start here then. You've got one, one piece-- I see you got a couple of sheets there.\nYOLANDA: Oh, yeah, but this is just...\nKEITH DOBSON: That's from before.\nYOLANDA: Yes, from before.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, okay. So tell me about what happened here then.\nYOLANDA: I was thinking about my plans for the New Year-- for-- like New Year's -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, New Year's Eve.\nYOLANDA: - New Year's Eve and my birthday which is like my birthday is a couple of days after.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And, uhm, just trying to figure out what I wanted to do if I wanted to combine the, the celebrations or what -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and then I thought how I would like to have dates, uhm, a date for the New Year's and a date for my birthday like I did last year.\nKEITH DOBSON: Was it the same person or different?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I was with the same person last year.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Uh-hmm. And then, and then I see the thought, can't make the same mistake again.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Beca-- because -\nYOLANDA: Because ...\nKEITH DOBSON: - because of who the person was?\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: Well, this is okay. Okay.\nYOLANDA: Very much.\nKEITH DOBSON: And you felt some hope 20 or 30%?\nYOLANDA: Yes.\nKEITH DOBSON: And some apprehension more at 45%?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: And the behavior of just thinking again about what happened...\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Who you were with and the thoughts...\nYOLANDA: I just wrote down like the type of thoughts they were might be just thinking like, uhm, I gotta have a date or it won't be, you know, it was nice as I'd like it to be -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - or, uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: So but a strong as a-- I have to have a date or it's horrible?\nYOLANDA: No like. I'm no...\nKEITH DOBSON: No? No, it's not that bad?\nYOLANDA: Not that bad.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. Okay. Okay.\nYOLANDA: And then thinking like what if I do have a date and it ends up or results and like what happened -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - this past year.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: All of that. And then, it kinda, ah, rehashing like what happened in my relationship-\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and how I should have known better or...\nKEITH DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, so this is a relationship that ended last summer?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: That, that led you into your...\nYOLANDA: Well, it actually ended-- it ended in February.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: It lasted a couple of months.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: It was over. It was over by March.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated Psychological template:\n",

Okay, and then, you said, looks here like you've identified some possible distortions like all or nothing thinking, ah, catastrophizations fortunetelling which, ah, you know, cuz you have rephrase these here as you would like to you know, and so on and you, you don't really say this as if you're going to fail or that they're going to turn out badly but there is something as a bit of that worry?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah? Yeah. And then, personalizing, I think, so you're blaming yourself you mean?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. It took me awhile to forgive myself or even, uhm, well I guess staying in the relationship as long as I did. It was only two months -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - but there were-- there were some red flags and I was like, you know...\nKEITH DOBSON: Should have known earlier?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. Okay. Who ended the relationship?\nYOLANDA: Me.\nKEITH DOBSON: You did?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, at the end, you stood up and said this isn't working out.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: But it took you longer than you think it should have?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: That's all right.\nKEITH DOBSON: And then labeling with what is that labeling? I don't see that here.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, what did I've think about when I thought labeling? Uhm, I can't remember the definition now, but when I saw it I was like, yeah, I'm doing it. I'm-- I've done a little bit to that too. Uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: Labeling yourself or labeling the other person or both maybe?\nYOLANDA: Both and probably the situation.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. All right, so a number of a number sort of negative thoughts swirling around here. And then, you looked at that and you got some alternatives like I could have dates for new year’s and birthday that could lead to a great relationship. And so, that's a possibility, so that tends to undermine the catastrophic thinking, negative fortunetelling and if I date someone and it doesn't work out it doesn't make it a mistake or a failure. How does-- I don't understand that.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I guess because when I'm dating someone, I'm looking at it in terms of considering this person as a marriage partner.\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh, okay. Also, it's not, it's not just a date.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: This is-- okay.\nYOLANDA: Like I'm not cuz I don't-- it's not often that I date.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: So if I consider dating I'm, I'm considering you as a potential life partner -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - uhm, cuz I'm not really want for casual, just casual dating or whatever.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, okay.\nYOLANDA: So, uhm, it's probably in my best interest in going out with someone not to, see it as such a long-term way just-- I guess value the experience of it something -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - because I guess approaching it the way I have and approaching it, it leads me into, you know, being depressed or really disappointed.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: So...\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, I mean, your, your standard or your expectation is pretty high?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right? And so, if the person doesn't measure up as a partner -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: - lo-- long-term partner let alone the date, you know, the evening.\nYOLANDA: And then other part too in dating this guy I mean, that's the perspective he was coming from as well.\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh, okay. And he was looking out this is a long-term thing to you. Okay. All right, and so, so when you thought about it again your hope stayed about this, uhm, about 30% or so but your apprehension did go down a bit. Okay. So, so again, this is a good example I think to how, you know, looking at a, a trigger, you know, planning here, looking at the original thoughts, classifying them, reinterpreting, you know, you can actually see the negative feeling, goes down some and again -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - it's not, doesn't wipe it out, of course.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm, right.\nKEITH DOBSON: But-- and there's a good reason I think to have some apprehension, right, cuz you have that some, some negative experiences -\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - you'd never know, I mean, you could have a horrible experience, right? I, I mean, I hope now that it could re--\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: - but it could happen. So, so does this is make sense that in terms of looking at this again it looks sounds like you did a bit of this, you know, looking at the evidence like what has happened before and what you could differently. Now, what are some different ways to think about this situation?\nYOLANDA: Yeah, this-- I like this call.\nKEITH DOBSON: The, the alternative what is to look out -\nYOLANDA: Yes, yes.\nKEITH DOBSON: - yes. Yeah, yeah, it make sense. Uhm, so this is make sense that it just generally as a strategy?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Now, this is something it hasn't happen yet, right. This is like down in the road.\nYOLANDA: You're right.\nKEITH DOBSON: So you got some time to do some planning here?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Not a lot of time-- well, yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah? So how would you, yeah, I mean, I'm just curious I mean, I, I think you in terms to this exercise this makes sense. Usually for depression especially we find that people often beat themselves up after the fact like after an event has occurred, you know, then they kind of go back , sor of like what you did in the summer -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - thinking about it, great? Uhm, that's more typical in depression and this can also used even for things that have happened in the past.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: As well as for events that haven't happen yet in the future. So both ways but we can define this for future-oriented events. You tend to see worry, apprehension, anxiety and for past-oriented events it's more typically depression tha-- that's sort of the focus of the emotion.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: But it can be used either way. Yeah, yeah, I hope you can see that.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So let's just focus just for a minute if we can. How are you gonna manage this situation cuz I mean, it's coming down the line not too far away?\nYOLANDA: How I gonna manage it?\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. How, how would you try to set it up in a way that it wouldn't repeat like in the past year? You, you talked a bit about the idea about treating adjust as a date rather than a, a commitment.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: That's hard for you to do, I think?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, yeah, it is.\nKEITH DOBSON: And you, you said before that you're, you're not as young as you used to be and you're looking for a long-term relationship?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Uhm, like any I'm just not the whole casual thing. I, I-- uhm, I guess because I'm such a serious person too, I just, ah, I don't see myself just wearing it lightly or whatever -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Okay, so do you have like a standards for your potential partner?\nYOLANDA: There are things that, ah, I mean, like yeah, I look at and I observe about a person and...\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. So what were those be like?\nYOLANDA: You know, it was really big with me, ah, I kind of like controlling people.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I don't like to be barked at, ordered around, bossed around, any of that so if I sense that about a person I'm backing off.\nKEITH DOBSON: So if they’re aggressive or -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: - or even like overly assertive -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - dominant?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, are you looking for mutuality or are you looking for somebody that you can boss around?\nYOLANDA: No. I don't wanna be the boss either.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So it's something that's more even?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, what else? Someone who has a sense of who they are.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, and know we are all works in progress but I think some of us are little further along -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - than others and then just even if you're not just knowing that and realizing that, uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: So not-- so and again, I guess that was being not overly self-confident or too self-possessed or feel like they know everything.\nYOLANDA: Yes, someone who doesn't, yeah, definitely not, not someone who's know it all or whatever.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, but someone who I'm like they have a sense of themselves. They're not, you know, trying and they're still find there place in the world -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - necessarily.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: I don't know. Some of this a little more stable and secure.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm, Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: About what they're doing.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Make sense. Ah, again, would faith be important -\nYOLANDA: Oh yes.\nKEITH DOBSON: - with, with their personal faith that...\nYOLANDA: Definitely, Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, other critical kinds of things?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm, hm, well financial security, definitely.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. For a long-term relationship or for a date?\nYOLANDA: For a long-term relationship.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: But, uhm, it’s good to know on the first date too.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, if they tell you, you're gonna have to pay for everything and that's a good clue, right?\nYOLANDA: Yes. Yes, that's a really good clue.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, okay. All right. So, so now some of these sound like, like you are things you could let go for a date -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - but would be important for a longer term -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - kind, kind of relationship. Okay, when you go to look for a date so where, where you go around to do that?\nYOLANDA: I'm not really looking.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, if you were going to do that, how would you approach it?\nYOLANDA: Wow! How would I approach it? The last guy I dated we were in Bible study together.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So you met there, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I dare not say that I would look for a date in church just because that is you would think, ah, being a person of faith but not a lot, ah, ah, options there.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Not really. A lot of the guys in our church are already married.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So what, what about at university?\nYOLANDA: Sure. You-- yeah. This is probably ripe ground.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: But, you know, if you don't have a lot of classes with them -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - or you're not coming into contact like in this my particular program I don't see, ah, too many guys.\nKEITH DOBSON: I see, okay. So, you've just started to work?\nYOLANDA: Yes. That's a possibility but I've been in the situation before where, uhm, I really liked the guy that I worked with and it did not turn out the best.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. Can work relationships can be tricky, Uh-hmm?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Yes. So, uhm, I've sworn that off.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So it-- so and it-- the-- all right. So, what are your alternatives to this?\nYOLANDA: I don't know. Go to a dog park. I don't know. I, I-- that's a good question. I've been trying to rattle my brain to figure out -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - where do you meet, you know.\nKEITH DOBSON: Do, do you girl friends that you can talk to this about?\nYOLANDA: We talk all of the time.\nKEITH DOBSON: About where are the good men?\nYOLANDA: Yes.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. All right.\nYOLANDA: Yes. Yes.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: We do.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. And there's no success, no, no good answers yet?\nYOLANDA: No. One of my friends actually could meet guys all the time but the guys that she was meeting they weren’t you know, it didn't lead to anything -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - meaningful.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, so again, I guess it raises the question about how you're gonna approach this whether your gonna treat it as, ah, fun experience or what are you going to see it as a prelude to more, or potentially more?\nYOLANDA: Ah, yeah, ah, I mean, I feel like I don't have a choice in approaching it casually at this point.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

So, so this is one we're not gonna solve tonight?\nYOLANDA: No. No. No.\nKEITH DOBSON: No. So, uhm, well, partly I'm just curious to see how you would approach this cuz again in terms of, ah, risk for depression and this was a risk for you right the breakup of this relationship. And so, it would be nice for you to again approach relationships I guess in a way that leaves you less vulnerable I’m thinking? I'm not quite sure how to do that.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, certainly I think you know, ah, you know, you already pick up on this of course that if you get the vibes or you're going to see the red flags to have the faith in yourself and the trust in your own feelings to, to know this is probably a relationship you wanna get out earlier.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: I, I think that's probably good advice.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Which you know yourself, right? So, uhm but more than that I don't know. Certainly I don't know Chicago. I don't know either where are the opportunities are. So, ah, internet dating you ever do that. Have you ever?\nYOLANDA: I've not done internet dating thought about.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, any, any friends? Have they?\nYOLANDA: I actually had a friend who did it and it resulted in a marriage actually.\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh!\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So maybe it's...\nYOLANDA: But I haven't been ready to take that type of plunge.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay. So. -\nYOLANDA: Not yet.\nKEITH DOBSON: - another possibility?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uhm, I mention last time that this is sort of a, a different way to try to look at negative thoughts.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uhm, this is the question of, you know, what are, what are the implications of these thoughts? And, ah, what I'm thinking here is, uhm, well, in fact, let’s use your own example of, of this relationship break up, uhm, after the relationship, ah, fell apart back, in February you started having to think thoughts about it. Ah, I'm guessing that you probably had certain, ah, conclusions you drew about yourself, you know, from that experience or things that you thought about yourself or implications, you know, that, that, you know, that if that had happen to you then it must mean certain things about you.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, what did I think about myself? Ah, I mean, I should have known better.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So you should have known better, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, what else? Should have known better, uhm, I keep coming back to I was, I was trying to be open in entertaining this person in the first place -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - because normally I don't think I would have even gone out with this person.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: But, uhm, I was trying to be open and less judgmental -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and I don't know if that was such a good thing in this situation.\nKEITH DOBSON: That maybe you should have been more judgmental?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Or just trusted, uhm, trusted my own judgment, I guess.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So the fact that you didn't do that did again, did you draw any conclusions about yourself or...\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Like, like why, why you know, let me put this to you. Why would you have done that? Why would you suspended your own judgment or not trusted your own judgment?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, for once I was thinking that maybe how I want something to happen is not necessarily the way is going to happen.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So you're giving up control or giving up?\nYOLANDA: I think I was just trying to see things in different way or try to embrace something in other way instead of me thinking, it has to go like this.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay. All right, so this may be not the best example but no, for, for what I'm trying to say here -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - because often what happens in a case like this and what I was kinda guessing you might say would be something like, well, I, I was self-critical like after this happen. I was self-critical. I felt like I was a failure or I felt like my standards were too high or I, I don't know what you might have said but, but oftentimes if people get depressed about a relationship break up they often draw conclusions about themselves like there's something wrong with me or you know, my standards are too demanding, nobody can beat my standards. You know, it can be a variety things.\nYOLANDA: This was one of those situations actually where I didn't blame myself as much -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay.\nYOLANDA: - like, I looke at the person which is like no.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, it's kind of a mismatch?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. All right. So fair enough. So, so with this question though we tries to get as the idea that when, when negative thoughts emerge and -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - and negative feelings pop up in different situations you can say well, what are the evi-- what's the evidence that supports and doesn't support at this thought? What's the different way that maybe more accurate and more healthy way to think about the situation?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Or the third way’s to look at what does this thought mean about you? Or if possibly sometimes we know what the other person?\nYOLANDA: Now, something I didn't I mean, now was-- it did lead me to be, you know, depressed and disappointed cuz it was like is this ever gonna happen, you know?\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So one of the implications was made like your question is this ever gonna work out for me, right? So, I'm, I'm might gonna be a lonely person?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So let's take that then as a thought. If that was true that you were a lonely person and this didn't work out what would that mean? And what implication would you draw if that thought was true?\nYOLANDA: Ah, that a dream wouldn't be realized that I was gonna be this I don’t wanna say old maid but...\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Did you have a kind of a mental image of yourself was an old maid? Or just not...\nYOLANDA: Not really.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, just more of a thought like you might be an old maid.\nYOLANDA: It's just the idea of not wanting to, to wait until like I'm 50 -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - to be married.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

What if you were an old maid? What if you had to wait til you're 50 when you get married?\nYOLANDA: I'd have to suck it up.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. But, but what-- okay. So you're not really, well you're responding to that, but what would it mean though in the first instance why would you get depressed if you ended up being an old maid?\nYOLANDA: Well, cuz, ha-- I wouldn’t want it, uhm, I mean, it's just its one of those things that's not how I saw my life turning out.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, like I said it would be like a dream that -\nKEITH DOBSON: That was having...\nYOLANDA: - didn't get fulfilled that-\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - you know. Uhm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So would-- okay. So I lead you a little bit. Would you go as far to say that it would mean if your dream wasn't fulfilled that your life was meaningless?\nYOLANDA: Not meaningless but it would-- it was seem like I never experienced like real love or...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Was loved by anyone or...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay. Would you-- what it goes so far as to say that, ah, you weren't lovable?\nYOLANDA: I don't know if I would say I wasn't lovable. Uhm, I get in a sense maybe I might think I'm too hard to love or...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, so now we're getting out, ah, sort of the implications of so, you’ll get the sense that, that if there's a, a trigger like this, you know, sort of relationship break down, it could lead to this kinds of implications -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - that there's gonna be a hole in their life and never going to be fully fulfilled as a person and that were gonna find out part of my life for satisfaction -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - might be you could, you could draw those implications.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uhm, and oftentimes when we start looking at those questions like what are the implications of the negative thought. It leads very quickly to the core belief you have or your, your core values. So one of your values clearly are one of your parts of your life that you want as to have a relationship, is that right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: A meaningful relationship one of your values is that.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: And so, when you start looking at the, the implications of negative thoughts often it leads to that kind of awareness that I've got a value or I've got a belief and if this thought is really true then it means I'm not going to fulfill that, that value.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right? And that's part of why people get anxious, depressed and so on because of the implications they draw from the automatic thought, right? Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Now, now is it true though-- again, just to respond if you're talking about how to respond to these negative thoughts, is it true that people cannot be happy if they end up being an old maid or a spinster?\nYOLANDA: Oh no.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. Yeah, exactly right. So often in fact, that's the thing. It's that, if you look at the, the original automatic thought when people have the, the implications are often pretty negative and, and -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - you know permanent maybe stop and look at the real implications often it's not true.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. If you ca-- if you can sort of step away and say, well is it really the case that I have to draw this implication from this automatic thought? So you just did that very quickly and very well here. Uhm, but some people especially when they're depressed they have a really hard time doing that.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Like when you're caught up in the middle of the automatic thought, right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: But that's this third question. So again, if, if, if it’s helpful for you if you find yourself having negative thoughts to stop and say, well just a minute, what implications am I drawing? You know, what, what am I concluding from this negative thought and is it really true, you know, do I have to think that way and does-- is this the only conclusion I could draw?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: That make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, yeah, then like I say on the, on the form and like I sometimes call it the so-what question like, like so-- you can see right here in the form it says so what. So it's kind of like, well, if this happened, you know, my first impulse was to be apprehensive could I instead say like, well, so what? Like, you know, I'm not gonna worry about it or you know, this relationship didn't work out, so what? There's a more men out there. I'll go find somebody else, right? And that would be the kind of response that sounds a bit, uhm, you know, flip or you know, or kind of your, you know, ah, you know, unkind?\nYOLANDA: No. I actually, I actually had, ah, ah, mantra like that but I kind of like forgot about or lost it.\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh really?\nYOLANDA: Along the way.\nKEITH DOBSON: What was that?\nYOLANDA: So what, you know, -\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh really? How you'd actually use that, okay?\nYOLANDA: - I, I head so much-- I heard someone speak one time and I was kinda point to the message. It was kinda like, so what, you know, you kinda, I guess developing a thick skin -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and when stuff happens -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm, I love it.\nYOLANDA: - you don't, you don't really let it absorb you just -\nKEITH DOBSON: Yup.\nYOLANDA: - brush it off.\nKEITH DOBSON: And move on, yeah, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: And have faith in yourself and feel good about yourself. Okay. So, so I don't know if we need to talk more about that. So but these are the three, three ways that you can potentially respond. Again, if we had time with more time, more sessions we you know, practice this a bit more.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: What I've want to do is actually get you out there and you know, going into situations on purpose that would illicit some of these negative thoughts -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - so that you could get some practice responding to them. Uhm, but that will happen naturally.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: You know, you know, and so, here are some-- and this is the tool you can use.

I, I guess if we were leave here tonight with sort of an action plan for you to you know, keep getting healthy, stay healthy, stay non-depressed, what would you look like?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, actually I talked about this a little bit in my class last night, being flexible -\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh, okay.\nYOLANDA: - like when things happen, uhm, going with the flow and, ah, just trusting that things will work themselves out and that, you know, and I getting bent out of shape or -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - you know, if something doesn't go the way I think you should go, you know, embracing that, you know, as a, a different alternative or -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - you know, thinking that maybe something else what happen down the road, uhm, and just really, uhm, learning to be content with you know, where I am -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - at the time.\nKEITH DOBSON: And how do you do that practically? How, how do you develop contentment?\nYOLANDA: Ah, I have to pray.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I have to pray.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right, so prayer’s important.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: You say you have to what the...\nYOLANDA: I mean, that's what keeps me. It brings me back I guess as, as people say in yoga to center.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, and gets me focused again.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: So, yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, so that's important.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So contentment not-- I mean, you're not getting bent out of shape about things, trusting things will work out again as a part of that trust, the religious trust?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Like, like faith in God?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Like everything is gonna okay-- faith, okay. Flexibility is that hard for you to be flexible?\nYOLANDA: It has been in the past.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Now, how do you develop flexibility?\nYOLANDA: I just think having so many different experiences, uhm, and just trying to wanting to take control or wanting it to work a certain way or realizing that you don't have control the situation and you-- you'd have to go along like especially in the times you know, in the situations of employment.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, you just have to go with the flow. Your report to someone they tell you, you know, they give you a directive, you follow it. You don't really have, you really don't have time, uhm, and it's probably not wise to argue or -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - disagree or you know, refute you know, you just do what the directive is.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So again, you know, going back to relationships this could also be helpful, right? That you of being more flexible and more accepting of other people and differences, maybe even welcoming differences, well, you know, I don't know, as a, as a possibility?\nYOLANDA: Yeah, I mean, as long as the differences don't like I guess take away from my contentment -\nKEITH DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: - like if they-- if I feel like I'm not content in the situation -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - or I'm not peaceful about the situation -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm .\nYOLANDA: - then there was a problem which was...\nKEITH DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: The situation...\nKEITH DOBSON: So it, it-- so it goes back to knowing your core values...\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Trusting your core values -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - but then letting other things maybe be more flexible...\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: And being more adaptable yourself, yeah? Is that fair?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So if you’re trying to be flexible and you’re trying to go with the flow, how do you exert influence like if you have a direction? Like, so for example, around relationships, if you know that long-term you want to be in a caring loving relationship and that’s sort of inconsistent with just going with the flow?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: And going with the flow might get you there but it, it might not or...\nYOLANDA: Well, going with the flow, ah, is different being a doormat or -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - I mean, you can go with the flow but I mean, you still have thoughts and desires and wants...\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And I don't see a problem with expressing that.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. I, I agree 100%.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: In fact, I would say for a long-term contentment part of it is actually knowing your values -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - and knowing your direction and setting goals.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: You know, maybe not getting you have set about at the midst that they're not achieving next week -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: - but knowing that these are long-term goals or aspiration and working towards them.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Can I, can I write that down?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So knowing and, and working towards goals.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Is that fair?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. What other things can you think about in terms of long-term health? Can you talk kind of about stability you said earlier about not getting too stressed out about things is, is for sort of a shorter term strategy.\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right, you said at work that you don't wanna get stressed that you wanted to keep things kind of on an even keel?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I don't-- I guess, ah, cuz work can be-- the work is very-- can be frenzied.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: I don't wanna get sweep up in that.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I think a lot of people is that the nature of the business is stuff is changing all the time and I think people get too vested in a process when someone comes along, say, we're not doing that anymore and then, people like, why not, you know, I don't wanna do that.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, my goal is to get a directive. We're doing this, okay. Get another directive, we're not doing that anymore just...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Just go with that, okay. Okay. So then again, that will take some pressure off you, right. Allow you to enjoy that moment, more stay in the moment more, okay?\nYOLANDA: And just see-- I mean, this is a job. I'm getting paid, uhm, it’s not a lifelong career.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So keeping that in the perspective?\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: Actually can I write that down in general here. Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm, definitely.\nKEITH DOBSON: Keeping perspective.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nKEITH DOBSON: What about, uhm, I know for a lot of people having, ah, sense of community or you know, important relationships and maintaining relationships is important, is that for you?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

And, and I guess I'm not thinking of just about intimate relationships although -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: - that's important but also maybe women -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: - and friends, yeah, okay. Other things come to mind?\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nKEITH DOBSON: Now, that's, that's a long list already.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, like I was hope for the best.\nKEITH DOBSON: Hope. Trying to maintain hope.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: And that's, that's a challenge often, right? What I mean is a general strategy, yeah, right? Okay. All right. So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna get you may be directly there in your own handwriting.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So that you can take this a way as, as general strategies. Now, when we're finished, ah, will you seeing another therapist? Or do you have an ongoing, ah, -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - therapy some kind? So, uhm, how would you like-- what we have done here communicated to that person if at all or do you wanna just carry these things forward yourself?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I'm not sure-- I might carry these things for myself and maybe discuss in another later time.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: IF, it becomes out or...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, all right. So, so maybe what I'll do is that when we, when we finish the camera I'll get you to copy these over in your own handwriting but, ah, while, we're still on air.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Ah, right away, we just maybe take a second or two and you can tell me generally how you found this process like working together?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, dare I say say it was kinda neat.\nKEITH DOBSON: Neat, is that neat, right? Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, it's been insightful to see like to see this mapped out.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, cuz most of the stuff is just going on in your head.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And when you see it on paper you can actually you know, you get a visual of like, you know, what my thought process is and, uhm, -\nKEITH DOBSON: And you...\nYOLANDA: How we could change or needs to change.\nKEITH DOBSON: - Uh-hmm. Where it can reach into to some-- maybe negative roots for you know, and how you might be able to correct that, yeah, and this, this is actually one of the course skills that we use for people who are currently depressed or like, you know, suffering from anxiety. Your situation is a bit different of course, cuz you not currently that distressed.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: For-- fortunately, you know, for you which is great but the, the tools themselves can be used I think pretty generally I mean, I'm sure you can see of that. Uhm, so hopefully especially if you have a situation occur that you really going, oh my God and this is, this is terrible you could haul this out, I’ve given you actually some extra forms so you can take them away and you could use this as a tool, ah, anywhere down the road so you can use that. Uhm, if we were gonna work together over the longer term what I'd also want to is help you actually to start looking at these things were talking about more tonight.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: About some of these, uhm, again some of these are about positive things that you can do to develop your sense of who you are and where you going and offset some positive goals and work towards cuz I think you're right the sense that when you-- yeah, might-- well, I just give you some feedback if I may. And my sense of you is your quite a balanced and healthy person in lots of ways, uhm, you know, I think you probably have some vulnerability around relationships and especially but you know you've got a sense of where you want to go in life and now you're working towards it and you know, it takes a long time sometimes but you're functioning quite well and well I would say. Uhm, but if I was gonna work with you over the longer term we start moving on somewhat is more positive kinds of goals as well. So, so I would hope that over time you'll have that chance as well and, and that things would recover for you. So this has helped okay I take it...\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Ah, working together, us is that, that was, worked out okay?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. I, I felt it went okay.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. Ah, that's good. Uhm, any general feedback or comments you'd like to make.\nYOLANDA: I can't think of any. Ah, this-- it's been helpful.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: It's been helpful.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I was a little, I didn’t know quite what to expect in the beginning and then I'm was looking at this like, oh my goodness, homework but, uhm, -\nKEITH DOBSON: Maybe we should have used a different word, you know.\nYOLANDA: - but it was helpful.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay. But, but them, and the notion again of bringing itinto real life I think is important. I think a lot of times therapy is just talk.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: You know, and they, it's not always easy to see the applications.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm. Sure.\nKEITH DOBSON: That's important.\nYOLANDA: That's true.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. All right, so does it feel like we can stop here and maybe I get you the copy of this afterward?\nYOLANDA: Sure.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Well, I wish you all the best.\nYOLANDA: Thank you.\nKEITH DOBSON: And, ah, I'm sorry we won't get a chance to work more, but, yeah, c’est la vie, right.

But, of course, given the time we have, you know, and again I don't have many problems as you might have but, ah, trying to address them all maybe not possible.

DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - so I do have a tendency to see the negative side of things. And if I'm not careful sometimes it kinda pulls me in and I just focus on that.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, so when you say depression, how do you experience that? And what kinds of symptoms or signs of depression do you feel?\nYOLANDA: There's a heaviness -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - uhm, a hopelessness, uhm, just feeling like things aren’t gonna change or get better. Uhm, kind of even, ah, just expecting the worst.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, sometimes when people have those kinds of thoughts like expecting the worst or that things won't work out, they also tend to just slow down and not do as much.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, I mean, at its-- at the-- at its worst, I am like-- everything is slow. I'm moving slow. My speech is-- I'm-- I, I talk s-- slower than this.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, uhm, at the worst, I'm kinda just on the couch all day -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh.\nYOLANDA: - just...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Avoiding things or not, not of tending things.\nYOLANDA: Just-- I don't know that I will call it, avoiding things. It's like I don't have the energy -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - or the interest. Uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, low energy and interest. Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: What's your mood like at those times?\nYOLANDA: Oh, I’m sad, very sad.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like crying?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, yeah. I think I cry a lot more at night-- when I'm supposedly going to sleep.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: But, yeah, crying.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Does it get to the point where it seems pointless even to cry like why bother even getting that upset?\nYOLANDA: Like sometimes I just get tired of crying.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Like, I, I was like, I just don't wanna cry anymore.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, and so sometimes I won't even allow myself to cry cuz I'm just like, \"Please, I don't wanna cry anymore.\"\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm, uh-hmm. Sometimes when people get this kind of feeling, they also get a sense of hopelessness that you talked about and that they'd rather just to escape from the situation or get away. Does that ever happened to you?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah? Do you have thoughts of, ah, hopelessness and suicide?\nYOLANDA: Yeah, I mean, I have of about, you know, God, just, just take me.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Just, you know, uhm,-- yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So what we're talking about is when it's at its worst.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And when with that had been last? Or, or is that current? Is that going on now?\nYOLANDA: No, it's not going on now. Uhm, Let’s see how recently. I would say even this is-- uhm, maybe I would even say like the middle of summer.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so within the last couple of months you felt -\nYOLANDA: Hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that way. Okay, so, so quite recently. Uhm, compared to the worst than how much better is it now? Like, ah, how much have the signs and symptoms reduced?\nYOLANDA: It's significantly better now. Uhm, -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - I was stressing about a situation -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - and, uhm, I'm not stressing about it anymore. There was a little resolution.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so, so let's come back to-- so then, there must have been some kind of trigger then or something that's, that's...\nYOLANDA: Yeah. With me I noticed it's usually some disappointment that has occurred -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and, ah, that kinda sets me, kinda, in that off-- I guess, down that spiral or whatever.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, good. Okay, so one of the things I want you is to understand more about that process for sure, ah, cuz that's usually a good clue about how to intervene or where to intervene especially around the thoughts--.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: that, that you've talked about. Uhm, so one of the things I need to say though, I guess it was obviously-- if you're starting to feel that sense of hopelessness and that you're starting to spiral down over the next few weeks that I would hope you'd tell me that.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, you know, again I don't know actually of the specific state laws about, uhm, hospitalization and so on, but, you know, obviously, I wanna protect you from yourself if you ever feeling that hopeless and suicidal. So, so I hope you'd feel comfortable telling me that. And I know that you have an ongoing counselor so again, I would hope that you feel comfortable telling her or him\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - her, you know, if that was also happening. So, is that fair?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, great. Uhm, so depression sounds like it's been an ongoing problem. The symptoms that you're just talking about are the signs of what we would call \"major depression\" -\nYOLANDA: Hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - or \"clinical depression.\" You're probably aware of that.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. And it sounds like, back in the summer you probably would have been diagnosable with a case of clinical depression -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: You know how many times approximately?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, at least two other times.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: At least twice more. Okay, so I'm gonna ask you a bit about that later on if I can. Uhm, what about any other problems though? Are there any other things that you're wrestling with or other concerns you have right now?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I don't, I don't think so. Uhm, other than the depression?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: No.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, so for example, sometimes we, we know people that have a history of depression also tend to have anxiety, sort of feel stressed a fair bit of the time or feel pressured.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, I don't know if I, uhm,-- I don't know how much anxiety I deal with because, uhm, there was a time where I think I was out at some major anxiety and it lead to-- ah, it led me to how to take, uhm, medication for heart -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Hmm.\nYOLANDA: - palpitations.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh, okay.\nYOLANDA: And since that time, uhm,-- I mean, I, I pretty much decided. I-- I wasn't gonna let it affect me like that. And so, when I feel myself like kinda going that way, I try to remain as calm as possible.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so do you find a tendency though to get sort of pulled into being anxious or, or feeling more tense?\nYOLANDA: Ah, if I got my thoughts take me that way.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: But if I feel myself expressing it physically like -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Hmm.\nYOLANDA: - heart palpitations or something like that, then I, I, I try to really get a grip and not, ah, not to let it go there.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And what would you do specifically at that time?\nYOLANDA: I might even do deep breathing.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, just like I said, just trying to remain calm -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so...\nYOLANDA: - and not get upset.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Now, that's good. So where did you learn that technique of deep breathing?\nYOLANDA: Where did I learn it? Uhm, oh my goodness, dare I say, Oprah. Uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: It could, it could be, yeah.\nYOLANDA: I’m like, where did I learn that? I'm not sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: But, but you've picked it up somewhere -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and, and that seems to help that if you, if you find you're getting more anxious, you can do deep breathing and calm yourself down.\nYOLANDA: And I realized, too, a large part of it-- had to what I was thinking about at that time.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: So -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: - if I was thinking about something that was making me anxious and I felt my heart racing or whatever, I was like, \"Okay, I need to stop thinking about this.\"\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so, so then you're trying to cut those thoughts -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - off, right? How would you do that?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, prayer.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, mostly-- mainly prayer.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So you sort of shift your focus of attention from what you are worrying about to prayer and help yourself calm down?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so if that's an effective technique and for you to-- to help you feel better, -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - to feel less stressed, okay, so that's an important thing to know. Okay, uhm, so I hear depression, I hear some tendencies towards anxiety or stress but sounds like you're managing that pretty well right now. What about any other problems you have? No, any relationship concerns?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, not at the moment.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: No?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Wo-- okay, I'm, I'm guessing that might have been the trigger that we were talking about earlier.\nYOLANDA: Well, I was, I was in a relationship for a couple of months -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - and I noticed the effect that it was happened on me like I wasn't as peaceful -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - and content as I have been. And that was my sign to get out of the relationship.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And it was-- so it was going on in the summer again?\nYOLANDA: No, actually it wasn't.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: What was going on in the summer, well, I, I felt like I needed to forgive myself for being in the relationship in the first place. During the summer, I was, I was mad at myself for -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so are, are finances like an ongoing concern for you?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, there's a light at the end of the tunnel, I guess which is what help me kinda not be so stressed and depressed about it.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, but yeah, there's still a concern for me -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - cuz I'm not working right now.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, so, so money -\nYOLANDA: Hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - availability is an issue-- okay, so that may be something we can come back to as an issue to help you. Uhm, so relationships then, it sounds that you were in a difficult relationship, the one that you weren't happy about being in. Ah, you got out of it, sounds like, so it gave yourself credit for that but you were still critical about being in it -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - in the first place. So, is that fair or staying in it maybe longer than you thought you should have?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Is is like that? Yeah, okay. Uhm, are you in a relationship now?\nYOLANDA: No.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, is that a concern for you?\nYOLANDA: Yes or no. Uhm, it is a concern in that I've been having to accept my condition, if you will. Ah...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Sorry. When you say condition, what, what do you mean? Like being single?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, okay.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, exactly.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: And, ah, I ju-- I had a lot of expectations from myself and I'm realizing that I'm having to let those go.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, you know, at this time in my life I thought I would have, you know, been married by now and, uhm, I guess I had at least a child.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: And, uhm, I think after the-- I ended the relationship, well, I don't have to think. After that, I ended the relationship, ah, I was just kinda like this is never gonna happen.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, how old are you now if you don't mind me asking?\nYOLANDA: I'm 35.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Thirty-five years old, okay. And where do you live?\nYOLANDA: Chicago.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah, well, I guess you have memory like how do you live or where, where and whom do you live with? Are you living alone?\nYOLANDA: Oh, I, I actually stay with my mother.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, you're living with your mother. Okay, and have you since you were an adult?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. The only time we've lived apart was when I was in undergrad.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, and then you went away for college -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - did you and, and then you moved back -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S.

DOBSON: Yeah?\nYOLANDA: I mean, there have been times, uhm, where it's been hard because I had this expectation of-- well -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - I've said expectation about living on my own. I had actually plan to move into my own home before I quit my job.

DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: So...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So quite a while ago, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, and sometimes even these relationships, the, the child almost becomes a caretaker for the parent. I don't know if that's true in your relationship.\nYOLANDA: I mean, sometimes I can feel that and that, ah, I have to remind her to do certain things or whatever.-\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And I get on her a lot about her health.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: But, uhm, for the most part, she's still pretty able.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. And she able to let you do your own thing too like...\nYOLANDA: She, ah, she mothers a lot.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: She does. Okay.\nYOLANDA: Yes.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So what have you heard on her if you actually-- do you get married and move out?\nYOLANDA: I have no idea.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I think-- one time I think it would have been.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I'm not so sure now.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. All right.\nYOLANDA: I think she's hopeful for me and she would like for me to do that.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh, sure. Okay, so you share that -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that idea? Okay, great. Okay, so I hear finances are bit of a problem, ah, not being, you know, married happily, having children and so on as a longer term kind of concern, or something you’d like to address? Uhm, the depression from time to time, some stress. Anything else? How's your health?\nYOLANDA: My health is okay. Uhm, I like to lose a few pounds.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, I, I think it's, it's okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Ah, any, uhm, legal problems or other kinds of concerns? Okay, so these are the big ones. So, again, in the time that we have if we were going to pick a target, something that you thought that we could work on reasonably within a period of time, what would it be? Of, of these various issues, uhm, like-- it’s unlikely I suspect, that we'll get you married and having children, in the next six, ah, six weeks.\nYOLANDA: Oh, uhm, I would like to learn to be content, -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - you know, you know, with the situation, with, you know, where I am now. Just, just to be content.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. To be more accepting -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - or, more...\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so it's like to be less stressed out. And, and you mentioned earlier this idea but not focusing on the negative learning how to, like, maybe shift your attention or learn some techniques to cope with this negative thoughts.\nYOLANDA: Right...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Would that be helpful?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, so this might be preventive strategies than to prevent you maybe from another episode of depression.\nYOLANDA: That would be great.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: If-- so that will be useful things to you? Okay, ah, any other things that we could meaningfully do? And the economic problem, maybe, you know, that the job issue. And I don't know as much about that.\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like-- do you want to work right now?\nYOLANDA: Do I want to work? I need to work.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: The wanting to work. Uhm, I would love to work in a job that I enjoy going to.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: The thing is every job that I've had, I've hated -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - which is why I'm back in school. So, yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I, I know I need to work but the wanting to work is...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Not so much, yeah. Okay. And I hear you. Uhm, and what are you taking at school right now?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I'm in the grad program here at Governors State, the Counseling Grad Program.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so you want to be a counselor -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - yourself? Okay. And how far away are you from graduating.\nYOLANDA: Oh, I'm a little ways away. This is just my third trimester.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. And, and do you have a sense of the career prospects like are they good ?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I would have to work with, uhm, ah, couples and families.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. All right. Good. And are there positions like that in the Chicago area?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I'm sure. I don't know. I guess I haven't really thought that far ahead.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I kinda thought like what I'd like to do ultimately -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - which is, uhm, run my own organization.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh, okay.\nYOLANDA: But, uhm, I'm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Do-- doing that kind of counseling. Okay, okay, that's great. Okay, so then you probably or somewhere along the way wanting to build some business skills, too, right, to, ah, to learn how to run...\nYOLANDA: That make sense.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Some-- but, you know, that can be down the road as well.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So it's sounds like if you're doing some kind of work, it would be really something shorter term to bringing in some money while you go to school. -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - to build your career -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - in longer term. Yeah. Is that fair? Okay. All right. So, again, that's probably something that's unreasonable in the time that we have to work on. Uhm, but again-- I think the idea about learning some techniques to think about things differently or -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: Yeah?\nYOLANDA: Definitely.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: That would be worthwhile. Uhm, okay, so, so why don't we set that us our general strategy? Uhm, there are actually a number of techniques that have been developed for helping people to work with their thinking -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - uhm, in which particular ones are gonna be helpful for you. You know, it's impossible to know upfront. And different people have find that certain ones are better than others.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - ah, slight and I’m guessing a bit in your case you've said already that prayer is helpful for you. And I'm guessing that part of prayer acceptance like learning to accept into sort of live with the, the negative situations that you might be in.\nYOLANDA: That's probably a big one.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: That-- that's a big part of that. Yeah. So, acceptance is certainly a part of cognitive therapy, learning how to change your thinking that way. But there are other techniques as well. So what I think I'll probably do is over the time I should tell you about some of them -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and then what we can do together is explore whether or not they're gonna be useful for you. And if they sound like they might be, we can try some experiments or exercises where you try them out at home and then in the next week, you can tell me how they worked or not.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: A-- and then if you know if they're useful, then you can use them and if not, you can let them go.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Is that, is that make sense? Okay. But to do that, first, I think what I need is a bit more information if I can.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Sorry, uhm, you said you have three episodes approximately in your life when you have been depressed.\nYOLANDA: A major, yeah, major depression -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: A ma-- major depression.\nYOLANDA: - at least.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: At least?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Saying-- you said before that you've had a history most of your life.\nYOLANDA: Like, I can remember, ah, being depressed as early as like the fifth or the sixth grade.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. A-- and was there something that happened out that time? Again, a trigger of some kind or...\nYOLANDA: I really can't recall so much of a trigger. Uhm, -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - not for-- not fifth or sixth grade. I mean, I just know -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - like my affect was just really just low. I just, just remember not feeling so good about myself -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - during those, those years. And even in, uhm, even in the seventh grade, I remember feeling like that too.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, so, again, it's hard to do, I know we’resort of going back so far in time but if we could imagine, how would you describe yourself at that time? Like, if we go back and imagining yourself then describing yourself?\nYOLANDA: Feeling like inadequate, uhm, I guess probably not pretty enough, like I didn't have the, the coolest clothes, uhm, always di well in school and, uhm, I had friends -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - but I guess I just didn't really think that much of myself. I realized a lot of it, I kinda let a few people kinda decide or define who I should be or whatever.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And if they didn't accept me, I kinda felt bad about myself.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And were these are the kids at school -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - or people you knew-- Okay. And so, you let them sort of judge you and make you feel badly about yourself -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - or you accepted their judgment, kind of?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Is that fair? Okay, so basically it sounds like kind of low self-esteem, questioning yourself -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - from a fairly early age on.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And, and then, ah, for some people like that, again it will go along like that and there's often a trigger at it sort of sets off the first episode of depression or some event that occurs. Not always but sometimes, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Right. I mean, I, I had to associate it with an event, then it was probably because some guys like didn't like me -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - probably I was having a-- had a crush on someone and they weren't responding to me the same way or...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Ca-- can you remember an event like that? Or, or is this your...\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh, you do remember then\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And, and when was that?\nYOLANDA: Seventh grade.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So you experienced this as a rejection?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: I got you weren't, you weren't being cared about by this person.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I now rejection is, is difficult for me.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, great. So, in grade seventh, you had , ah, it sort of sounds like maybe more of a slip into the first depression.\nYOLANDA: Cuz I remember -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - I remember telling everybody I was depressed.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh!\nYOLANDA: And I think at that time I thought it was an okay thing to say or -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - it made sense the same, or people will understand. But in seventh grade, people don't-- and they're like, \"What is she talking about?\" -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nYOLANDA: - you know. So...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, but the feelings you're talking about earlier and that kind of sense of what's the point in trying, ah, it did this.\nYOLANDA: I remember just feel like really like insignificant like if I die, who would care.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Like, who would miss me?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Would you go further and say nobody would miss you if you died?\nYOLANDA: I, no, cuz I don't-- I mean, my mother would miss me.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So you, so you have an answer to that.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: But, yeah, but still the question would come to mid. Okay, so I was in grade seventh and then when was your next episode of depression. What would you say?\nYOLANDA: And probably my sophomore high school.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: It was a similar thing, just feeling like really insignificant -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - like, like I was invisible, like, uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And, and do you remember what might have set that off?\nYOLANDA: Hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: With that pattern of thoughts again, with that kind of reaction?\nYOLANDA: I think I just-- I remember feeling like overwhelmed by high school.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I was watching some people just really flourish and be happy and have a good time and I wasn't having a good time.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Ah.\nYOLANDA: I just-- I didn't feel like I felt, ah-- fit in necessarily or-- yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Ah, so you felt again kind of isolated or, or separated? Not doing as well. Was there any sense of comparing yourself to other people?\nYOLANDA: Oh, yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: So-- and that you weren't doing as well like you were somehow sort of failing or not measuring up. Is, is that fair?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I mean, especially socially, not so-- not academically but socially.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Definitely.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Yeah, cuz you said earlier that you're academically tend to do pretty well. Is that, is that fair?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So most of these issues, it sounds like you're really around social rejection or -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - social comparison -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - right, or not measuring up or not feeling cared about. Is that fair? Okay. Uhm, and then beyond that, you said that was in your sophomore year.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And then the more recent ones.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, you're talking about like after sophomore year -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah after.\nYOLANDA: - or recent? Uhm, after the sophomore year probably was my freshman year college.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. And what happened there?\nYOLANDA: Ah, I was living with my best friend in college and we fell out. And, uhm, and there was another thing where she seem to be adjusting better to college life than me.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And all I remember just feeling just kinda not like I feel fit in or -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - that same thing.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So you had a break up with her, like a fu-- a fight or like a disagreement?\nYOLANDA: We stopped speaking and we're living in the same dorm room -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - so that was really difficult.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So that’s, that’s tough on you. And she was your friend like best friend -\nYOLANDA: In high school.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - yeah, in high school.\nYOLANDA: We were in high school. We were friends in high school when we decided to be roommates in college and...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: It didn't work out.\nYOLANDA: No.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And have you made up since or...\nYOLANDA: Uhm, we will like talk-- via the internet or something. We have-- like, I've, ah, -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Hmm.\nYOLANDA: - complimented her. She's, uhm, a mother now. She's married now with a child. And I, I commented on her child being cute or whatever -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - but, ah, we never were friends again.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so you never really repared that -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - relationship? Uhm, so that sounds that you-- I mean, I'm, I'm hearing a pattern -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and if you think back about the depressions, does they almost all involve some kind of social comparison or social rejection? Are there any that breakout of that pattern that, that you can think of?\nYOLANDA: Now that you mention it, I, I don't know. I don't-- I'm starting thinking not.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so that sounds like there really is a kind of a theme here or pattern.\nYOLANDA: Hmm, uhm, well, I remember my first job out of college was, ah, as a case worker -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and I became depressed, ah, during that time. But-- I mean, I, I associated that with work cuz I hated my job.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, and I think there were there, ah, there are some other times that I associated with my work and that's so much-\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - my relationships.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. And at those times when you became depressed, was is it because you're unhappy at work and you felt like it wasn't for you or...\nYOLANDA: Searching for meaning just, uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: My first job during the college during the case work I was just not prepared for it -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - and, uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So that a sense of failure perhaps?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. It was like-- I went to college and I'm on this job and this is it, like, this is what I want to college for, you know.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: I was just really disappointed, ah, really bummed-out -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - about how it was turning out.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I think I thought after graduating from college and getting a job that I should be on this road to success -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - you know, set for life or something. And...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: All right, so, so let me just give you some feedback from what I'm hearing generally. Ah, there's couple of things. One is that, you know, this, this theme of interpersonal rejection or loss or, you know, the interpersonal comparison sounds like a theme that-- ah, so that sets you up for feeling badly about yourself. Uhm, the other one I guess I'm hearing is this idea of expectations, right, cuz you-- you're just now talking about expectations and you've talked earlier about -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - expectations for yourself as a, as a bride and as a mother and in life, your goal experience, that sense of expectations and how if you don't measure up. Again, you find yourself wanting and you get self-critical and shit down towards depression. Ah, it's also interesting for me that you said that one of the things that helps you sort of recover your mood is acceptance. Like, you know, through prayer, for example, you know, trying to accept your situation as it is. And, ah, one of the things about acceptance of course is it undermines expectations -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - right? Cuz if you just can't accept the way things are, you lower your sense of demand or expectation on yourself and it sounds like you find some peace through that.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, yeah. That's a, that's a good way to put it.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: I-- is this a-- this sound fair?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Can, can you think of other examples that don't quite don't fit that pattern?\nYOLANDA: That don't fit the pattern.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yolanda, what I was just talking about, about expectations or social sort of you need. And, again, on the positive side, I guess what would I say is it sounds like you're the kind of person I really wants to have social connection.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: You want to be intimate. You want to have friends and partners and so on. And when that's not successful then you get disappointed and hurt maybe and, ah, depressed.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Uhm, there's also a side of me that is kind of leery. I want these relationships with at the same time because I guess the rejection I felt or the disappointment I felt, uhm, I can be very distrusting.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Sure.\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Cuz you've been burned before. And you were saying, or hurt.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah, so if you enter a relationships sort of with one foot in then one foot out, it -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S.

DOBSON: That's something that the other person's going to do that to you. So, is that one your general beliefs to what other people that they might hurt you or-- that, that if you let yourself be vulnerable, you might be hurt by them?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Hmm.\nYOLANDA: We're disappointing each other. We say things that hurt each other's feelings.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: It's a risky run -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - for sure, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, but I think I am, like, uhm,-- somebody said that everybody starts up with 100% with them when they meet them and I, I know with me, people start up with 0%. It kinda have to build up.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: So...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So they have to earn your trust.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right, yeah. So your initial approach to people is, \"I'm, I'm gonna wait and see what kind of a person you are.\"\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: That's interesting. Okay, so we must be more difficult and in some ways feel really m-- push pass and get kind of intimate relationships or, or feel that you can really connect with people if you got that one foot out the door kind of attitude.\nYOLANDA: Well, you know, I mean, I, I strive to just be myself -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and, uhm, not really trying so hard with people. I just decided to, look, I’m just being myself. Uhm, people once they get to know me, they seem to like me or whatever.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I don't know if I would say that about everyone.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: And I'm always like-- my radar is always up.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right, right.\nYOLANDA: It's always up. Even if I have a good relationship with someone, I'm still kinda like I am still waiting for the shoe to drop.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah, yeah. Okay, so there's a kind of expectation there again. So, and again, given that history of being hurt and, you know, makes perfect sense, right? So, okay, so, uhm, just a one more question in terms of background if I can. If, if you met somebody for the first time, so they didn't know anything about you so that's, you know, ah, I-- I'm gonna ask you this question for myself. But then we've been talking for a little while so I already got some hunches. But somebody never met before and you were going to use three adjectives to describe yourself. How would you do that? Wha-- what adjectives would you use?\nYOLANDA: I would say down-to-earth -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - uhm, analytical -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and the word warm comes to mind because I can be warm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: I can be warm once, once, uhm,-- I guess you get to know me.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: But I don't...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So...\nYOLANDA: It's not very visible all the time.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh, okay. So warn with an asterisk or-- right?\nYOLANDA: Yeah, I guess.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, fair enough. Okay, fair enough. That's good. So, so, again, I'm hearing in somebody wants to be connected.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And that you value that and, and you like that. But again, you've been hurt. You know, over, over time, you went through various disappointments. Uhm, some of that, in some ways, you set yourself up a little bit for -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - disappointments through your expectations.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right, and you find yourself wanting or, or you're sensitive to other people, too, who maybe make comments that make you feel that you're wanting or short in some way, uhm, that, that you don't measure up in some way.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And then, you tend to focus on the negative you said.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Ah, the cognitive models like whenever we're talking about cognitive therapy-- so the cognitive model, in general, talks about an idea called \"schemas.\" I don't know if you ever heard of -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that term before. Yeah? So, what do you know that to be?\nYOLANDA: Ah, schema is kinda sounds like, uhm, I guess it’s is a default way of thinking.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah, it's kind of a general belief -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - or general--general way of thinking that you carry around with you forever. Ah, well, not necessarily all your life but, you know, you, you've learned -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - over years to learn and think of yourself. And it comes about based on your experiences, based on your, your life patterns, based on the things your parents tell you, based on the media. I mean, all sort of influences can shape your general beliefs. Uhm, and again, I just asking you in a way about your own self beliefs -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and yourself schemas. So, part of them is, yeah, analytic, like you said, and warm, you know. So you have some positive elements of your self-belief, ah, but it sounds like again, you got some negative elements in there too that from time to time pull you down -\nYOLANDA: Hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - or make you vulnerable.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right? Uhm, so I think what we believe is that the schemas or the things that we carry around with us to get activated when there's a trigger or some kind of a stimulus -\nYOLANDA: Hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that sets them off, and in your case, it sounds like it's disappointment or rejection -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that you carry or social comparison, that sort of becomes the trigger for your negative schemas and then activate the negative thoughts. And that, once those thoughts get activated, the sadness and the sense of the what's the purpose in trying, the, the, the heaviness, the difficulty getting going are kind of the natural consequences from that process. So if you take that model-- so, I mean-- well, first let me stop and let me see if that make sense to you -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that idea. And of course, once you start to feel badly about yourself, it makes the schemas and these thoughts more, more easy to pop up anyway.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right, so it doesn't take as much for them to, to be elicited-- so-- and of course, if you're not doing as much, chances are it's more difficult for positive thoughts to emerge as well, right, so you're getting to this kind of vicious cycle you talked about earlier. So if you take that idea though, uhm, you have different strategies-- I mean, again different strategies emerge for dealing with depression. One would be to help you pull just to simply feel better -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - like magically somehow. So medication -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - you know, it's one strategy that people are using.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: That help them feel better. It does give them energy and gets them out of that cycle. Ah, another is to increase your activity level just to start doing things even if you don't feel like it -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: Does that make sense -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - to you? Yeah? Now the difficulty is of course, ah, right now you're feeling pretty good. It sounds -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that-- yeah? You're, you're sort of on the positive although you're not in a relationship, right, so, so again it's more difficult in a way to work on this negative thoughts cuz they're probably going to be less frequent these days -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - cuz you're not facing the trigger or the, -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - the stimulus that would set them off. So, so what we could do I guess is talk about some general strategies for dealing with negative thoughts. See which one of those have some traction with you or make sense with you and then try to get you to experiment with them.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: But to experiment with them, it's going to need you to get out there and activate these kinds of thoughts so that you can actually work on them. So I don't know how you feel about that.\nYOLANDA: The word activate is interesting.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. How, how, how so?\nYOLANDA: Ah, activate sounds like it could, ah, involve some other people or-- I don't know.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Well, it-- it possibly could, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: I mean, again-- ah, I mean, obviously anything will be your choice.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: You can do things or not do things. And, uhm, what I would often do is I in fact ask you what you think will be a good homework assignment, ah, so I wouldn’t be telling you what to do. Cuz, you know, again, I don't live your life -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and you do have to make those decisions yourself. Uhm, but, you know, again, I think if you did that, you could then try to experiment with whether these ways of dealing with negative thoughts when do pop up are effective or not.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: That make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, uhm, do these negative thoughts come to you still even now though you're not particularly stressed like in the past week, for example, how they come up?\nYOLANDA: In the past week, uhm, I, I probably have to say yes.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Can, can you think of a specific example when that would have happened?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, probably, my current living situation -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - just thinking about it and say like, \"Man, is this gonna, is this gonna change, am I, you know...\"\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, so there were some negative thoughts in that? Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And was is it specific event or was is it a general kind of thought you had?\nYOLANDA: I think that was triggered by, uhm,-- we have some neighbors that just I guess get on our nerves.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: And, uhm, sometimes the sight of them, they get -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - trigger a negative thought.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, so that happened for you. Okay, so one of the things that will be very helpful for me-- again, this isn't learning how to deal with the negative thoughts yet but would help me in our work together would be for you to start paying more attention to your negative thoughts -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - when, when they occur and the situations that seems to trigger them. And then what kinds of emotional and behavioral consequences once you have those negative thoughts. So what sets off the negative thought and then what happen afterwards, right? If we could start paying attention to that process -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that would help me get a better sense of how I could help you possibly learn some techniques to counter them.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Now, one of the things I don't-- have you ever read our cognitive therapy or seen any?\nYOLANDA: A little bit.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So have you ever seen a thought record before? Do you know what this is?\nYOLANDA: I'm not sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So I'm, I'm just gonna quickly draw you, and I know we don't have too much time left today. But for, for homework what I'd like you to do is to actually start to do this, keep this kind of record if you would. Now, I'll, I'll just describe it to you and see if it make sense. Ah, so we start with the trigger or the situation and this could be-- sorry, my writing is not very good-- uhm, this could be an external situation like something happens with your neighbors for example. It could be a memory -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that, that you have or something happening. The emotions. Oh, sorry. Oh, okay, this is a bit busy. What the emotion is that, that, that elicits for you. It could be sadness, helpless, uhm, you know, it could be various things. Uhm, oh, no let-- so let me do it in a different way as this--that this maybe better for you, ah, since, since you are fairly intuitive and you do this. So let's pay attention to those thoughts first, those are what we called the automatic thoughts that just sort of pop up at that moment.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So that thinking that you have. Then, the emotions. And then, if there are any behaviors or any actions that you take as a consequence of these thoughts. So it could be relieving your situation, it could be, you know, you know, turning to prayer, it could be a variety of things, you know.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I've seen this before.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: You have seen this kind of thing?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So have you seen this filled out before from, from people?\nYOLANDA: Ah...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: In, in textbooks maybe.\nYOLANDA: I don't know if I, if I saw-- I, I don't know if I saw them, a video or was discussed in a, a text -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - that I was reading.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: One or the other.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Cuz for us to learn how to deal with these kinds of negative thoughts, I need to know a little bit more about what there are -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - which go-- which ones are popping out.\nYOLANDA: Okay. Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And then once we know what they are, we can together explore different ways to cope with them -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - or manage them and then look at different techniques that might be more helpful for you or less helpful.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, uhm, let me just put this to you and see if this make sense as a strategy. It-- does-- do you think you could do this?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Do you see any -\nYOLANDA: Sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - problems in doing this for homework?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, only in it adding to the other homework that I have to do.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay. So how would you, how would you do this effectively then? Uhm...\nYOLANDA: Uhm...\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: - and, and jot them down?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Again, it doesn't have to be detailed, ah, but especially if you have a really good negative situation -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - you know, you feel, yeah, so for our purposes, you know, a, a good negative one, ah, that would be very helpful if you could just make a note of that. And then we could start there next time looking at it, understanding these process a little bit more and then start to figure out some strategies. Is that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. And I'm guessing again just from what we've said tonight that the kinds of themes I am going to be looking for are going to be around disappointments, the expectations and then disappointments. And again, this, this notion about social, social rejection or social isolation especially a trigger. But we'll see over time if that's actually true or not.\nYOLANDA: Okay, great.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: That make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, I think we should stop there tonight, okay?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Is, is there anything you wanna say? Anything else? Was there anything tonight coming here that you wanted to to tell me in particular that we didn't touch on.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm. I can’t think about of anything.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: No? Is there anything in your past that we didn't focus on that you think is important that I know?\nYOLANDA: Hmm, uhm, oh, we might wanna discuss, uhm, my relationship with my dad, I guess.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, do you think that's important again in terms in developing your, your sense of who you are?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. All right, so I’ll make that a note for myself for next time? How did you feel that we managed together today?>\nYOLANDA: Fine.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah? You said before that you often enter into relationships kind of one foot in, one foot out, did you do that tonight?\nYOLANDA: I probably was wondering like, \"Okay, what, what, what is this gonna like?\" I think I felt a little bit better realizing that, uhm, ah, we were gonna be talking about cognitive therapy.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, and so now having spent you know, 45 minutes or so together, how do you feel right now?\nYOLANDA: I'm fine.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah? Okay.

How are you doing?\nYOLANDA: I'm fine.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah. How was your week in general?\nYOLANDA: Pretty good.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. No particular problems or concerns?\nYOLANDA: No.\nKEITH DOBSON: No. You’re into term now I know, ah, as student, right? So -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - are you getting exams, anything like that going?\nYOLANDA: Not yet. Have a couple of papers due, ah, coming up.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Great. Are you procrastinating on them at all?\nYOLANDA: Yes, yes.\nKEITH DOBSON: Ah, okay.\nYOLANDA: Ah, I'd plan to work on a paper last week and didn’t so...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So I remember last week you said that, that's one of your concerns -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - procrastination so maybe we could use that tonight as an example and, and talked about how to work around procrastination.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: So that it might-- something to think about for our agenda tonight. Was there, was there anything coming tonight that you wanted to talked about in particular?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, no. I can't think of anything in particular.\nKEITH DOBSON: No, okay. Uhm, were you're doing your homework, ah, I'm gonna see-- have one sheet at least.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: So you’re able to do that.\nYOLANDA: On one situation. Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: About-- that-- okay. So we can talk about that then use that as an example. Also at the very end of this session last week I gave you the list of different kinds of distortions -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: - and you may well have had some questions about that. So we can go over that tonight.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. I also tonight coming in-- excuse me-- still have a bit of my cold, uhm, I wanted to, uhm, sort of review the model a little bit again with you and explain maybe about you know, where this just the distortions comes in -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - and again make sure that you understand why we'd, would look at this.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay? Great, okay. So, ah, sounds like three things then procrastination, this situation and then the distortions which would we, we go on to go through first. Excuse me.\nYOLANDA: And since we talk about the procrastination get that out of the way.\nKEITH DOBSON: Is that right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Why would you want to do that first?\nYOLANDA: Ah, I guess why procrastinate about talking about procrastination.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. Okay. That's great. Okay, so that's with that and then maybe we can look at this situation and then go back to the list at the end.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. That'll be fine, okay. So tell me a bit about, about your-- you've been putting off?\nYOLANDA: Ah, catching up in my reading for classes. Uhm, there's one assignment, a weekly assignment I have in one of my class is-- I mean, I-- it's a weekly assignment so I know that it's gonna be due but I don't do it as soon as I, I could do it and get it out of the way.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And it's-- actually it's a report, uhm, about what has transpired in class -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - so it would make more sense to actually do it right after class but I usually put it off for a couple of days, three days.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uhm, so why would it make more sense to do it right away though?\nYOLANDA: Well, we're talking about what's happened in class and so, uhm, and talking about what's happening in class I have to give examples and stuff like that.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: And even though I'm writing this stuff down, it's more fresh in my memory, you know, right after class instead of letting a few days pass.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. And so, when you get the thought that you're going to do this assignment what stops you from doing it at the moment or?\nYOLANDA: Ah, I think, ah, I think I dread doing the assignment just because it's a, it's a reflection and I'm just-- I think I have convinced myself that I'm tired of doing reflections. And so, uhm, the thought of doing another one, ah, it just, just doesn't excite me so I'd put it off.\nKEITH DOBSON: So you're not excited or you're actually dread it? Cuz there-- there's a difference in that, right?\nYOLANDA: Yeah, uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: So, so if you can't put yourself in the moment of, of sort of thinking I'm going to do this. What kinds of thoughts would pop up-- again, if we use this kind of this, ah, ah, formula for looking at it, you know, there's a situation which is the thought, I'm gonna work on this assignment and what kinds of automatic thoughts pop up again in the way, maybe...\nYOLANDA: Uhm, not another reflection it's pretty much the-- it's pretty much the thought.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. That and that it's just I-- not another reflection? What-- now what does that mean?\nYOLANDA: It's, it's kind of-- I mean, it's like, a kinda like, ah, you know, not having to do another reflection because I-- they have to be done weekly and actually I had to do it for another class -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm\nYOLANDA: - prior to this term. So, I guess it kinda feels like I'm still having to do reflections -\nKEITH DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: - like it never stops.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So that's another part of the thought it never stops and is there any other reaction or?\nYOLANDA: No. I mean once I do it it's not a terrible thing, it's not that -\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: - complicated necessarily but, uhm, at the same time it's just not something I...\nKEITH DOBSON: So, so again what kinds of emotions does that illicit though when you have this re-- reaction like oh, not another one? It... do you feel...\nYOLANDA: I guess irritation.\nKEITH DOBSON: Irritation. Okay, okay. So irritation. Uhm, would you go so far as to say angry?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, it would be very mild.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I guess it will be something like, why do I have to do this reflection but it's not...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay. Now oftentimes when people have irritation or anger it's often as thought-- that’s tied to that something that you're in-- somebody else is imposing something on you.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: And, and you resent it or you don't feel like it's appropriate or, uhm, I don't know. Again, I don't know what the thought maybe for you but there is any that resonate for you?\nYOLANDA: I can see that a little bit and wonder why the teacher has us doing these reflections every weekend.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Like, like this is excessive or this is too much or?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, okay. And do you had-- can you figure out some angry thoughts or some thoughts about the teacher or, or some resentment, you know kinds of thoughts?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, probably it could feel like busy work just like -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - just...\nKEITH DOBSON: So, so like the teachers imposing busy work on you and it's a bur--\nYOLANDA: Sometimes yes.\nKEITH DOBSON: - it's a burden?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: And any self-doubt about that-- your ability to do that?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I guess I'm just wondering if what I come up with is actually gonna be-- is gonna be correct or is gonna make sense -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay.\nYOLANDA: - ah, or if I really understand the assignment enough to give good answers or...\nKEITH DOBSON: So certainly this is a self-doubting or self-questioning a bit. It sounds like there too as well. Okay, so a number of things going on really sounds a partly irritation, partly why is this happening, partly on here's another one -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: - partly, how can I do this. Sounds like you also to some extent having a day or two to think about it might help you mull it over a bit. I'm, I'm guessing right? Ah, just sort of you know, cogitate or think about the issue?\nYOLANDA: Yeah, or, or get over my dread over it -\nKEITH DOBSON: Or that, or that too, yeah.\nYOLANDA: - I guess.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, okay. So we've had a bit of a discussion and as we think about it which would be the most effective to think, would it better generally to do it right away or, or would it be better to give it a day or two and then, and then assign it to yourself?\nYOLANDA: I would rather get it out of the way.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. You-- it's okay.\nYOLANDA: Just so I don't feel-- I tend to feel pressure, uhm, -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - because of other things I have to do.\nKEITH DOBSON: Sure. Yeah, you got a busy life, yeah. So, okay. So, if that's the case then, how could we help you to not procrastinate? How could you set it up in such a way that you wouldn't?\nYOLANDA: I guess for me I have, I have to think about the other assignments and like or imagining myself under so much pressure that I don't want to be under that pressure -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: That it's better to get it out other way you move, moves on.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, if you're able to tell yourself something like it's better to get it down and move on would that help?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So it's-- that's something you could do.\nYOLANDA: I-- yeah. I mean, I’ve tried it.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. And, and do-- and does it help when you do that?\nYOLANDA: I'm trying. Sometimes.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Sometimes it helps not all the time.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Anything else help?\nYOLANDA: Anything else help, I don't know. Uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: We-- well, let me ask, uhm, how much time do you actually have to do this? How long does it take actually to do this kind of a task?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, It might take me, I don't know if takes me an hour or something maybe sometimes to -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - flesh it out.\nKEITH DOBSON: So approximately an hour?\nYOLANDA: Maybe.\nKEITH DOBSON: And, and how do you find that time? How do you make an hour available for yourself?\nYOLANDA: It's really not that hard to do actually. I'm not, uhm, I'm not working -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - so, it's really did-- there's really no, ah, it could be the fact that I have too much time open.\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh.\nYOLANDA: That creates the problem actually cuz there is nothing really pulling at me -\nKEITH DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: - or demanding my time.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So then, so that's good in a way cuz it gives you more liberty to, to do it but it also as a problem because then there is no structure-- there's not as much structure on your time. So, do you have any way to structure yourself?\nYOLANDA: I'd been trying to figure that out.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: I mean, I-- I'm, I'm sure I could. Uhm, I guess it's just about me actually doing it.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Well, well let’s use this as an example then let's see what would happen if you do? Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So what day is this class are?\nYOLANDA: It is on Tuesday.\nKEITH DOBSON: Tuesdays, okay. So probably last evening, okay. And have you done the assignment yet?\nYOLANDA: No.\nYolanda No。\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, okay. Uhm, and so, today is Wednesday, ah, after this I know you've got a class this evening and so you'll be busy starting from then but there's gonna a break between now and the class. Are you tied up then?\nYOLANDA: No. I don't have my materials with me thought.\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh, okay. So you couldn't it right now, okay.\nYOLANDA: There's actually a part of it that I could probably do that I could start it.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

So, if you were going to do that with this particular assignment when could you do that?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, it would probably make sense to do it, uhm, I'm thinking noon on Wednesday or something like that.\nKEITH DOBSON: Today is Wednesday. Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, the time is past fast.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH DOBSON: You mean to wait till next Wednesday?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm. No.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: But I mean, I had-- I know I have to do it. I was just thinking in general.\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh, you mean in general?\nYOLANDA: In general.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay.\nYOLANDA: What I mean is...\nKEITH DOBSON: So you get this assignment on a Tuesday wait until the Wednesday noon -\nYOLANDA: The next day.\nKEITH DOBSON: - like the, the day after each one, okay.\nYOLANDA: Well, I, I was even thinking in terms of, uhm, Thursdays doing-- trying to get my homework out of the way on Thursday since I'm in class Tuesdays and Wednesdays and just focus.\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh, I see. Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Thursday on, on getting my, my class work done.\nKEITH DOBSON: Like while it's still fresh and so, yeah. So for-- less likely this particular I know for this week, so it was assigned yesterday sounds like it probably won't get done today cuz you don't have the materials here. So tomorrow morning for example, is there some way that you could schedule this?\nYOLANDA: That would be kinda hard because I'm actually going out of town.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: So, uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: Well, you tell me it then, you know, you, you-- cuz you know your life better and your schedule better what, what would work.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, what is feasible? Ahm, uhm, it could possibly get done Thursday afternoon -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - Thursday evening.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay so...\nYOLANDA: But I still be out of town so, yeah, this week is kind of -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - it's a little sketchy.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: And the next two days is a kinda sketchy cuz I'll be out of town.\nKEITH DOBSON: And when do you come back?\nYOLANDA: Saturday morning actually.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. And then what happens on Saturday?\nYOLANDA: There, I'm, I'm actually meeting with some friends Saturday afternoon.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, ah.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, so this week is a tricky, tricky one. So this is, this is probably a good example of why not to procrastinate, right, cuz, cuz things just get on and on, right?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, so this we get sounds like it’s tricky so we've sound me-- you know, it sounds like Wednesday is maybe are gonna be the best in general but Wednesday noon already passed by so I'm hearing Sunday maybe is gonna be the first real opportunity you might have.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Yes, Sunday and Sunday is the 11th, okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Is that, is that about-- right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, such as great actually in the way because what I would propose and if you're willing to is to figure out the time on Sunday when you could do this assignment and then next week on Tuesday you'll get another assignment it sounds like and then if you could experiment by doing it on Wednesday on noon next week by the time I see you next Wednesday evening, you'll have had two assignments.\nYOLANDA: Well, you know, what actually Tuesday we don't have class -\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh, that’s too bad, too bad.\nYOLANDA: - we don't have class but we're supposed to be working on a paper that's due for that class.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, so then maybe you could assign yourself to do that cuz I was thinking what we could do is actually contrast by delayed or, or procrastinated assignment on the Sunday versus one that you did right the next day and see how you're feeling and think about them differently. See if, see if one feels better to you or not.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I can guarantee that one we feel better than the other -\nKEITH DOBSON: So?\nYOLANDA: - cuz when I do the work ahead of time I, I do feel so much better.\nKEITH DOBSON: So you do, okay.\nYOLANDA: It feels like a weight is lifted off.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So you know that yourself?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. Okay. So, all right. So this week is sounds likes it's a, it's too bad but it’s gonna have to wait til Sunday. What time on Sunday would you do it?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I'm thinking four and that's because Sunday I'll be in church.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, until something maybe like 3 o'clock or something like that.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay. So would you like to schedule for yourself Sunday at four to do this assignment? For one hour? Okay, and then, now when you do if you could and again I'll give you pen to write out, ah, if you just may, maybe making on the bottom here that when you do it see what kinds of thoughts pop up at the time so as you're-- as you're structuring yourself and as you're beginning to sit down to do the assignment on Sunday at four to see if there's any kinds of thoughts that either facilitate and help you get the work done or maybe that make it more difficult for you to do it, okay. So we use it as like again another kind of a situation or trigger that maybe will set off some negative thoughts and reactions. Make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, uhm, next time then, it sounds like it's gonna be a week Tuesday that you're gonna have your next assignment like that.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. Cuz it -\nYOLANDA: That won't be...\nKEITH DOBSON: There won't be this week whether be probably a week next?\nYOLANDA: Right, we won't have anything to reflect on, okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: So then, I'm wondering if you'd be willing to assign yourself on the Wednesday noon following -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - whatever, whatever that day is to then do the assignment, being right away like the next day?\nYOLANDA: Yeah, that would be the 21st.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, the 21st. We--\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: - would that be fair? And then again we can compare and see how these are so maybe you can make a note result there to there to do that. And again if there are thoughts that pop up either that help you or get in the way of doing it on the Wednesday right after on the 21st. I'll be helpful to look at too, okay?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So do you need to talk more about that tonight, do you think? No.\nYOLANDA: No. I don't think so.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So let's look at this situation that you brought in from last week.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Great. So why don't, why don't lead me through it.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm, okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Maybe I'll just show it up for the camera and you can, you can sort of take it through-- go ahead.\nYOLANDA: I was reading an e-mail invitation from my friend's husband and it was regarding, ah, gathering that he’s throwing for her -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - to bring. I wish I wasn't still single and...\nKEITH DOBSON: So these are the thoughts that...\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah? Okay.\nYOLANDA: And I was thinking I don't wanna be the only single person there with the bunch of married couples.\nKEITH DOBSON: Did you have a mental image of yourself sort of being alone with other people?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, well, after I saw who else was invited and I saw some other singles I just imagine myself like sitting near them.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So this cluster of single people -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - right. Okay. Yeah. Okay. And then the feelings were?\nYOLANDA: Longing.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Sadness and anxiety.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So 30, 30 and 20 and the action was... I can’t quite read it.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I just I've shrugged it off and looked at my other e-mails and read them.\nKEITH DOBSON: Oh, okay. So you started where you paid attention to this but you didn't really do anything with it?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: You just sort to carried on, right. Okay. When you say you shrugged it off it would like-- was it kinda like oh well, there is nothing I can do about it or, or you had-- I'm not sure exactly to shrug about means for you?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. It was kinda like, yeah, uhm, I'll go and it will be fine and -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - and yeah, nothing I can do about it, you know, not gonna get married before that day so...\nKEITH DOBSON: All right, yeah.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So actually were, ah, you're kinda answering some of these thoughts or talking back to some of these thoughts yourself, right?\nYOLANDA: Probably.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, okay. All right. So that's good. That's, that's a great example I think of how you can use this to be where it right now. Tell me more about longing and sadness I understand -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - you know, being other feeling you know, like I wish I wasn't single so sadness that you're not single, ah, anxiety, you know, I don't want to be the, the only single person. So I presume the anxiety was more tied to that -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - that, that you're afraid you're gonna be there and would be alone and so on. Ah, where does the longing come from? Is it, is it this thought in particular?\nYOLANDA: The longing is you know, wishing that I, uhm, could meet someone worthwhile...\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm. And form a relationship and -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - yeah. Okay. So that, you know, I wish I could bring a spouse what you wrote here, right? So it’s the wish to be married actually and have a partner, right?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I wish I had a spouse to bring, yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. And so, that's where the longing comes from, right? Okay. All right. Well, this is a great example because I think it does show the connection between the thinking and the feeling, uhm, the-- this-- as I listen to it, you know, like you know, you've put 30s, you know, 30 and 20 in terms of this severity. So these aren’t really powerful in kinds of emotions it doesn't feel like that you know, enough that you would notice them obviously.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: You know, like it would cause you some distress and as I look at it too the thoughts seem to correspond with the feelings, uhm, you know, there-- there's sort of a connection there so I kinda makes sense to me. Uhm, that, that these make sense to you like when you look at like this to help you understand it?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. Now, is this some kind of situation before that might have pop up and you would have kind of a, kind of a reaction to it -\nYOLANDA: Oh yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: - without actually stopping and thinking about why or what's that?\nYOLANDA: Oh yeah, yeah. Is-- this is something, uh, I guess I'm, ah, I'm trying to like be content with it now -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - there was a time when I was just like, I don’t know, I might cry about it or get angry about it or but, yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Like, you would be more distressed -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm\nKEITH DOBSON: - more upset.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Definitely.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, so you you do notice longing though?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. And there’s a void in your life. So what's this acceptance idea that you're talking about?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, the acceptance I guess is just not, not really wanting to be sad about it -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - anymore think about it, uhm, for too long cuz I, I feel like there was a time when I just thought about it all the time.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. And, and you'd make yourself more distressed too?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So you-- so this is part of the shrugging it off trying to let it go and -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: - and just sort of let it, let it be for the moment?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. Okay. All right and it's that why is that you can do that now or as before you weren't able, do you think?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I got a tired of just being sad about it.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Okay.\nYOLANDA: And so, I just kinda determined you know, if this what's gonna make me sad thinking about this all the time I should probably think about this less.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. All right. So is it avoiding it? Do you think or was it actually accepting it cuz again there's a diff-- there's a difference that I know...\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I don't think I'm avoiding it. I mean, it's just-- it's kinda a part of life now. I have friends that are married -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: -I’m not it's like what am I gonna do like -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - stop talking to them or disassociate, uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: Some people might?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I mean, I might of at one time too.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: But, uhm, now it's just like as kinda par for the course.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: It's like you know, you deal with it.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, so let's come back to that because I think that's probably an important issue but you know, for the moment I guess in-- and main thing I wanted to highlight again was the use of this kind of a record to stop and think about what's going on and what are the specific thoughts and then what are the reactions you have. Now, the second part of what I talked about last time was this idea about cognitive distortions -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - Can you remember that? We talked about this idea that sometimes when you have thoughts-- automatic thoughts some of them might be quite accurate -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - and some of them might be though negatively distorted or sort of negatively biased and we know actually from a lot of research and clinical experience that people with depression or people with the history of depression looking-- or like yourself, ah, sometimes tend to misperceive things or skew them in a negative fashion. So I gave you this list and we didn't have time to go over last time but I know you had a chance to look at it.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Uhm, so when you look at this-- first, did you have any questions about this or anything that wasn't clear to you cuz I know like I said we didn't actually go over in detail, right?\nYOLANDA: I mean, it mostly make sense, the only thing, uhm, it like, ah,-- it would have been nice to have like some examples of what they were talking about.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay.\nYOLANDA: Some scenarios or something.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, okay. So, which-- was there any in particular that you were kinda like, what the heck does this mean?\nYOLANDA: The-- all or nothing thinking -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - like an example of that, um, I mean, I kinda think of someone who has I guess like a one track mind that can only see something like -\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: - one way. I get yeah, yeah, I get that.\nKEITH DOBSON: Well, it, it be kind of like -\nYOLANDA: I get that.\nKEITH DOBSON: - I mean, an example might be somebody who, ah, who doesn't get an A on their paper and either do you get As here, I don't actually don't know, but doesn't get an A on their paper so they feel like a complete failure?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. So if it's not perfect then it's horrible. You know, that kind of thing can be -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - or if I'm not loved then I'm unacceptable, I mean, I'm unlovable person, right? So, if, if the sort of polar opposite of what the original thought might have been -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: - and that's more the example. So we also call it dichotomous thinking like black or white -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - and extreme thinking, right?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: So people that tend to see or don't see the sort of the middle grade, you know, so if instead of having an A you might only be 80% or 70% but that's better than 30% you know, that, that idea.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: But some things that didn't apply as much to you?\nYOLANDA: I don't think so.\nKEITH DOBSON: You did-- you didn’t resonate with that?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: I see you put a double tick here beside the word catastrophizations.\nYOLANDA: Cuz I know I'd been guilty of that -\nKEITH DOBSON: That you pu-- you predict negative things in the future?\nYOLANDA: - especially when I'm depressed-- yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: It definitely have an inclination to do that just, just feel like there's gonna be another bad thing happen.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. Right. And oftentimes in fact, when people do that, when they predict something negative, it zaps their energy -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - it kinda like, why should I even bother trying then if things are gonna turn out badly and it almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\nYOLANDA: Snowball effect .\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Exactly, right. Ha-- have you seen that for yourself?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, okay. So you saw that one. Ah, fortunetelling sounds like you know, it's similar in some ways, right?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: But you’ve done that?\nYOLANDA: I think so. I'm, I'm guessing along with that, that I have.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm. And you've got to double tick as well beside the one of called mind reading?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: And I know -\nKEITH DOBSON: So you-- are you somebody that knows what other people are thinking?\nYOLANDA: - I think I, I know I do that.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah?\nYOLANDA: I, I feel like I know what other people are thinking.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I'm sure I project that a lot.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, without actually asking them, you...\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. So, okay.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: And again sometimes that can become like a self-fulfilling prophecy to you, right?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: That because you knows what their thinking in certain way you react to what you know even if you don't and then, of course that just sort of perpetuates or becomes a snowball as well, yeah? Have you seen that?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. You've ticked some of the other ones too like disqualifying the positive, magnifying negative I presume?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, over generalizing. Taking things more personally.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: And then labeling. What, what kinds of things do you label? You've put a general label on something or someone, like do you label yourself?\nYOLANDA: Do I label myself?\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. This is, this is the idea that you see somebody do something or you see might see yourself, observe yourself doing something and then you apply a label and again depressed people tend to a label themselves negatively of course?\nYOLANDA: I'd probably do a lot of labeling of men that's...\nKEITH DOBSON: Of, of man in general?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: That's what jumps out of me.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. And what kind of labels do you put on men?\nYOLANDA: Oh, uhm, commitment phobic.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Ah, oh my goodness, what else? Ah, I guess like along the same lines, playboys, uhm, irresponsible, uhm, what else.\nKEITH DOBSON: Untrustworthy.\nYOLANDA: Uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: I'm pushing a bit here.\nYOLANDA: I mean in some I don't know doing-- I don't know if I'm doing-- pull that way about all men.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: So, I'm sure, uhm, uhm, I guess irresponsible, undependable -\nKEITH DOBSON: Indeed, uhm.\nYOLANDA: - uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So these are some way-- the ways that you think about men in general already sort of, when you meet a man you sort of wonder if they’re being a playboy, undependable and unreliable kind of person -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - irresponsible, okay.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay, so that's great. So, so that's great that you're able to recognize a number of these. Now, and I know right now you're not depressed, you know, so the fact that you can recognize that you do some of these things when you're depressed again, ah, what we know from people is that you know, people with the history of depression when they are depressed these things become stronger -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - even when you're not depressed they'll probably have a tendency in this direction anyway.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Yes.\nKEITH DOBSON: So what do I-- what I want to do sounds great. That's a good example. Ah, what I want to do though is show you again the model, let's just review that for you because I'd-- I don't know how clear it was to you cuz we talked about it in the first session and I wanted to go back again and, and just talk about a bit more for you, just to make sure you understand and about how this fits in-- how this idea fits in.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

So what I have-- but I would like to do is just go back to the basic idea. Did I do this? I did this in circles thing I think with you, right.\nYOLANDA: Oh, no, no. I don’t remember the circles.\nKEITH DOBSON: No, may-- maybe I didn't. Okay. So let's go through. Ah, the cognitive model as you-- which is the one we're trying to use here basically talks about different vulnerabilities to prog-- primary factors that made people vulnerable to depression.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: One of the things that you carry around within yourself and those include things like beliefs, you know, general attitudes, ah, and what we also called looking back and explain with this is schemas. Did, did I use already?\nYOLANDA: It talked a little about schemas.\nKEITH DOBSON: We talked about it, yeah. Right. So, so these are things that we carry around inside yourself and then we have a different kinds that triggers or situations that, that occur that make us vulnerable, all right? So, there, there are these two general things. So, ah, what are some of your beliefs or attitudes we've identified that make you vulnerable to depression?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I'm thinking-- feeling like a failure, I guess.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, exactly right. Yeah, yeah, cuz you've talked before and in our very first session you talked a bit about the sense of being a failure and, ah, in particular it sounds like around relationships, uhm, sounds like you still have this idea about part of the void in your life being the fact that you don't have a, a marriage and you're not in a meaningful relationship. So part of your beliefs is that to be, ah, I'm, I'm guessing a bit but partly of your belief is that to be, ah, full person you need to be in a relationship, like that? Or, or that, that somehow will complete your life?\nYOLANDA: Uhm...\nKEITH DOBSON: Some-- something like -\nYOLANDA: Yeah, it would add meaning to it, sure.\nKEITH DOBSON: That would meaning to your life, okay. Yeah, maybe not to complete in, ah, sort of absolute sense but -\nYOLANDA: Right,\nKEITH DOBSON: - but that-- that's an important thing for you?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, okay. So some of your beliefs, you also has some beliefs about other people like men in particular, right? Untrustworthy, right? Dange-- dangerous, I don’t know, maybe I’m making, making that up but you have beliefs that you carry around. Now, where do these beliefs come from?\nYOLANDA: Ah, my encounters with the men.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, your experience, right.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, exactly right. So, so your experiences, yeah, your life experience, you know, that's, that's where these beliefs, attitudes, schemas come from but once they're there you know, if we tend to carry them around with us and they're sort of part of us, right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: They affect the way we are. Then you run into different kinds of situations or triggers that interact with these beliefs or schemas and then they lead to this interaction leads to situation specific automatic thoughts, right? So automatic thoughts, we’ve already started to be working on. You already started to, to track them a little bit, you know, so this kind of a record form.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right, cuz here's the trigger or situation, here's the automatic thoughts that popped up, right? And then they lead to different kinds of feelings and behaviors. Okay?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Can you see all this process sort of unfolds? Now, some of these automatic thoughts might be quite accurate. So for example, let's say that the-- a man was critical to you, right, so you're in attraction somebody said something cruel, uhm, or-- you know behave irresponsibly, right? So that maybe a thought where you go, oh, yeah, he really was that kind of a person and you know, you might have a negative thought but it fits the facts. Other situations you might have the same kind of negative thought but it's maybe more driven by your beliefs.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. So maybe the, the trigger or the situation wasn't so much but you because of the strength of your belief see it anyway, okay? And that's what we would think about more as distortions.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: So, so some of these automatic thoughts could be accurate and some of them could be distorted, right? Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, and again, generally speaking what we would say is that the more that the automatic thoughts are generated by the core beliefs or the schemas, the more likely they are to be distorted.\nYOLANDA: Say that one more time.\nKEITH DOBSON: The more that-- I'll put it another way, that if the schema or belief is what's driving the automatic thought.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: It's going to be potentially less in contact with reality, more consistent with the, the belief and more likely to be distorted, right?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: So for example, you might magnify a situation based on your core belief -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - not necessarily based on the situation.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Is that, that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah. Then, in a way it doesn't matter because what you have the negative thoughts whether they're accurate or distorted you're gonna have you know the feelings and, and the behaviors that, that come from that automatic thought but understanding where this thought comes from then becomes critical because it can tell us whether or not we need to go back and look at where these beliefs came from and what they are. Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: So it-- can you say that back to me. I-- maybe I'm not being as clear as I, I should be but maybe you can say it back or tell me what you understand about what I just said.\nYOLANDA: The way I understand it is that, uhm, well, a lot of the thinking that we have has to do with what we're already believing -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm\nYOLANDA: - uhm, and trying to figure out how to say it, uhm, even though what we're thinking might be true the tendency is that you're gonna see it as true anyway because of what you believe.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. Exactly. Yeah, we tend to see what we, what we think we're gonna see, right? We look for evidence that supports our beliefs, ah, we tend to, you know, disqualify information that maybe doesn't fit with what we believe, you know, and so our, our thoughts tend to be consistent with our core beliefs in our attitudes, right. And maybe sometimes because of that tend to be misperceive or distorted from the reality. Now this happens especially when people are actively depressed.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Right. This failure idea, right. So I wonder sometimes if in different situations you tend to see evidence that supports the belief that you are failure when maybe in fact other people wouldn't see that kind of information.\nYOLANDA: It's possible.\nKEITH DOBSON: So yeah, again I'm thinking about this particular situation. You have a thought here right about some you know, not wishing you're a single, uhm, you're wishing you could be you know, with a spouse not wanting to be the only single person or looking like the only single person. I wonder to what extent those thoughts maybe are driven partly by this fear of being a failure like an interpersonal failure or failure in relationships?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm. I don't know, I mean, like as-- I think once upon a time it was definitely stronger and I could say, yeah -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - I could say that this had to do with me feeling like a failure. Uhm -\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: - but as time goes on like I don't, I don't see it that way but mostly I don't see it that way because I know so many people in my situation...\nKEITH DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: So there's a comparison. It's not necessarily because I think I've realized that I'm not a failure cuz I'm not a failure but it has to do with me looking at it in relation of other people.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. And you think that is now because you're not depressed and because you're sort looking at things a bit more objectively?\nYOLANDA: That's, that's highly possible.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Cuz back in the summer it sounds like you were, you were thinking more of the way I just talked about but -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: - but it was, you know, that was after an interpersonal break up.\nYOLANDA: Uhm...\nYolanda Uhm.。\nKEITH DOBSON: No?\nYOLANDA: Well, not the break up really necessarily I don't know if it necessarily triggered feelings of failure. It was more like well, like I'm still single.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Okay.\nYOLANDA: And I don't know if I was feeling so much like a failure. I mean, there was definitely disappointment involved but -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - I wasn’t necessarily blaming myself for the failure. Well, then again I kinda was, I kinda was holding in myself responsible for even allowing the relationship to go on as long as it did.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So that was a bit of over responsibility or blame that you took for.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. So, so this may not fit exactly and again it's a bit more tricky when somebody is not depressed, ah, trying to figure out what some of these triggers are.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Uhm, but this is general idea make sense to you if this kind of model?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. It does. It's interesting, I mean, I'm, I'm really getting a gauge on the power of beliefs -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - like I mean, you kinda have an idea about how beliefs, you know, motivate people whatever but in terms of just like depression it's like, wow, you know -\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: - just the, the automatic thoughts that just simple-- basic thoughts being linked to a whole belief system it's kinda...\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, it's very powerful and in fact, it happens automatically I guess -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH DOBSON: - partly in our automatic thoughts and we don't stop and think about it and partly because our thinking tends to be consistent with our beliefs. We just assume it's true.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: That it’s, that is accurate.\nYOLANDA: Yeah, yeah.\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah, I mean...\nYOLANDA: That's, that's kinda scary, tricky thing about it.\nKEITH DOBSON: Right. So what, what I think we need to do is actually help you and again what would I propose over the next few weeks we do is help you a little bit more you use this kind of a method to capture some of these more, some more of this automatic thoughts and then what I'd like to do next time is actually work with you to show you some techniques to evaluate how evidence-based, how realistic these thoughts are or how potentially distorted they are, okay?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Does that makes sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Ah, so what I would like to propose as homework for you if you would accept it is basically just to continue this and hopefully find another situation or a trigger that, that gets you upset.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: It's not very, it's not very positive I know, homework of it but I'm looking for something that's you know, that maybe, you know, again, 30 is good but if there something that happen to you that really sort of push your button -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: - that would be even more effective for us to work with and, and to show you the power of your thinking in that situation.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: But, but if it's like that, that's fine. You know, but if you could just pay attention and look for another example or two, that would be wonderful.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH DOBSON: Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, I know we have to stop soon but let me stop and just see if you have any, ah, way or summarizing or talking about what we talked about tonight. Like, if, if you're gonna summarize tonight's session how would you do that?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, if I was gonna summarize -\nKEITH DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: - tonight's session. I would say that, uhm, uhm, everything that we talked about, ah, uhm, -\nKEITH DOBSON: Okay. In, in 10 words or less, yeah, I know and I'll actually give you that for you to take away.\nYOLANDA: - I mean, first and foremost, the again about the beliefs, our beliefs, uhm, are very, ah, what's the word I'm looking for they influence our, our thoughts heavily and may lead us to feel different things and act certain ways -\nKEITH DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - uhm, and I guess depending up on uhm, well, depending upon where we are in life the things that we think as a result of our beliefs can either be healthy or unhealthy.\nKEITH DOBSON: That's great, yeah. Okay, good. Now, it's a good summary sort of like the power of thinking.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH DOBSON: And how can either take you up or take you down depending on what you do with, yeah. We also talked a little bit about the notion of distortion versus realistic thinking and you know, some negative thinking is realistic, you know, and of course that leaves you in a different direction. Then, if it's distorted but again, we can talk about that maybe next time. Great, okay. Any reactions to tonight. Just general reactions or in, in general we're now halfway through approximately, so any reactions to how we're doing?\nYOLANDA: Ah, it's, it's good stuff. I'm, I'm learning a lot about my thinking.\nKEITH DOBSON: Good. Okay. Well, that's important.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

Any, any crises that happen in the past week or nay other issues?\nYOLANDA: No crises, ah, new development I actually, ah, gotta call on yesterday about a job\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - that they want me to start tomorrow.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Okay.\nYOLANDA: So, uhm, it’s gonna interfere with, ah, our appointments -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - unfortunately. And I was trying to work something out but I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do that.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, so just to be clear this job starts like immediately?\nYOLANDA: Yes.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And when does it have, like for how long is the day or...\nYOLANDA: Uhm, do you mean the hours that I'll be working?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah. Uhm-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Ah, 8:30 to five.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So that would, that would-- that would definitely make it difficult to come here for four o'clock, okay. Uhm, so what, what do you want to do and what your propose. Have you asked them about any possibility of, ah, getting away cuz our next appointment again had been plan for two weeks from tonight.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And then the one after that three weeks down the road from that. So I don't if, I don't know if that be possible to get permission to, ah, come for physicians appointment or doctor's appointment.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, well I can find out cuz I don't, uhm, I've not meet like who my supervisor is -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - or, uhm, I don't have any of that information yet -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - cuz the site it's totally new site and they're hiring people, you know, brand new or whatever so, uhm, if I go in tomorrow maybe get a feel for things, uhm, I'm even interested in working a different shift.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: So if I can get some information about possibly working a different shift or something -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - it might be doable.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So-- okay, so we definitely need to figure this out before, before you leave tonight. Okay. And you said there were no other crises this week. All right. Uhm, so we wanted to work on this and, ah, I'd said last week that we wanted to talk more tonight on how to work with negative thoughts -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - how you kinda answer them. And so I'd like to do that tonight if we, if we can anyway, ah, cuz I like you to have that sort of, ah, you know, we have that discussion.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, I guess I’m not quite sure how to, how to proceed though cuz I also said I know that one of the things I want to do is to by the end of our time give you sort of a plan for future -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - future therapy. So, ah, of course I haven't cut out prepared for tonight. I didn't anticipate the discussion. So, uhm, Well why, why don't we proceed on the basis that, ah, for the time being we'll just assume that the next appointment is okay.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: If it's not, if you need to cancel it or if you need to, to change it, ah, cuz I'll be coming back again that, that last time after the sixth appoint, ah, you might be able to make one of those two times.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And then we could have that as our final appointment or if they can make the change and you can get here and we can just carry on as normal.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: For you would that be okay?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And then what, what you can get is maybe contact the people here and then they can send the message to me so that I know whether you'd be coming back or not.\nYOLANDA: All right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And what I would do in any event, ah, if tonight is our last appointment, I'll write out, uhm, some recommendations anyway and I'll send them through the people here to you.\nYOLANDA: Okay. All right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, and if I can see you again that will be great and we, we can do it in person.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Does that make sense? Uhm, probably about the best we can do, right? Depen-- depending on the work, I mean the work is probably more important, right then, then coming here in some ways I'm thinking, I'm guessing.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Well, I'm here in terms of finances, sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Sure, yeah, yeah, that's important. Yeah. Okay. Ah, so that would be a reasonable way to handle that?\nYOLANDA: Sounds like it.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. All right. So then we'll just, uhm, assume how I'll assume that we'll see you again. I'll see you again and if not and that's unfortunate but hopefully I will be able to. But at the very least I’ll send you the written document.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, great. All right. So then why don't you tell me little bit about what your discover at the homework and, then we can take that maybe as a jumping point to talk about the other homework. Cuz there, there's a part of the session.\nYOLANDA: Okay. Uhm, so over the weekend, I went shopping with friends and, ah, we were going in and out to these different shops. And -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - I was gonna buy a hat and scarf set we-- I was gonna use, ah, my credit card -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and all of the shops had this rule where you had to spend at least $25.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And then they were kind of...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: You mean, to use your credit card?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And then, they really didn't want to handle the merchandise like they don't want you to kind of I guess browse or look through it or and that it made me kind of angry, uhm, about the situation and I just ha-- I guess I, I categorize the merchants as cheap and greedy in. And then I felt like I was being discriminated against and, uhm, I don't know I was kinda wanna like, you know, like what is the big deal like am I not good enough for, you know -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - just so it was a few different things going on.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: That good, that, that good enough idea popped up again?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. And I felt like, you know like why is-- why the hassle, you know -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm, uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - what so-- uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So it's this. So this is good example so it's, ah, an e-- a sadness, it’s a more, yes. So I can see it actually you've written down a lot of anger here. In fact you are done anger twice.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Again, related each of this thoughts?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - where they sell like handbags or jewelry and stuff like that.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, so your first thought was they’re being cheap and greedy. So what I'm guessing that, that-- again before you can have this you probably had a, you noticed something. So did they have a sign up that said $25 or did somebody come and tell you this?\nYOLANDA: I went to the register to purchase the hat and scarf and that's when, ah, clerk told me and then I started to notice that about every store, every store has the same policy.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Okay. So this was the thought that sort to start, sort to crept up on the on you as you went out through the different stores. Okay. And what's this discrimination idea and being discriminated against?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, at the. It has a lot to do what this st-- the stores were mostly are owned or run by a certain particular persuasion of people and I guess the history of, ah, relationships between my culture and their cultures -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - is little tense.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. When, when you say culture, do you mean colors?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Skin color black?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, so these are Whites people -\nYOLANDA: No.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - people that around you?\nYOLANDA: No. They weren't White people, they were Asian people.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Asian people. Okay. And but you think that they were discriminating against you because of your skin color?\nYOLANDA: You know, it's that's kinda...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: This is, this is the thought they come on?\nYOLANDA: It is, it is the thought that comes to mind it just in relation to past, ah, -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - incidents and stuff it-- it did that thought come to mine.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. And you also you had you've heard in here as a question, \"Am I not good enough?\" Did, uhm,-- so, so you-- you're right, I think what you're asking here is really, \"Am I not good enough for them?\" Is, is that fair enough or, or was it a thought that -\nYOLANDA: Or to be, or to be respect...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - or is it that you thought about yourself?\nYOLANDA: Well, it’s more on relation to, to them like -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - you know, I'm shopping in your store, you know -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - was-- you know, why I can't I be respected as a consumer, you know?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, yeah, I'm guess I'm asking the more to understand whether not this was a thought you had about the way they might have been thinking about you or whether not this was a thought you had about yourself.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like the way that you noted yourself in terms of being good enough.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Cuz you written down sadness here as the emotion and usually when I see that sadness is something that we direct towards yourself.\nYOLANDA: I'll say a, a little bit of both.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, so partly about them and then part the question again, \"Am I not good enough make myself there?\" So can-- so I just written down the same way.\nYOLANDA: Sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Often times when people have these kinds of thoughts the questions, \"Am I not good enough?\" In fact you have the answer as well.\nYOLANDA: Hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right? And so, so we ask ourselves this rhetorical questions like, \"Why this does happen to me?\" Or, \"Am I not good enough?\"\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: But often we-- ourselves have an answer to that. Is-- I don't know if you had have thought of an answer to that thought yourself.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like for example, you know, the thought, \"Am I not good enough for them\", would you go so far as to say something, \"I'm not good enough for them? or they don't think I'm good enough?\"\nYOLANDA: I must say, \"They don't think I'm good enough.\"\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. Okay. So, so that one-- we have actually a more definitive kind of answer to it. This one am I not good enough for myself. And would you go so far to say something like, \"I'm, I'm not good enough for myself?\" Or, \"I question my value?\" Or...\nYOLANDA: Yeah, I might say, \"I question my value.\"\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So and that and literally that's what you're doing here.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, okay. So and it sounds like when you do that that's more tied to sadness. When you think about them it's more tied to anger.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Is that fair?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: In fact that's all to what we find is that when you have negative thoughts about other people like these ones -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - you tend to see more anger as an emotional reaction. Sadness tends to be something that we direct more towards ourselves. So, so this is a great one, okay then you ended up not spending money in any of the shops. So, it's kinda like was it a protest thing?\nYOLANDA: Yes.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah?\nYOLANDA: Yes.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like if this is why you're gonna treat me I just when I'm kinda give you my money?\nYOLANDA: Pretty much.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Fair enough, fair enough. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uhm, oh this, this was part of the, the homework?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: The, the reflection. So nothing popped up particularly for that?\nYOLANDA: No. Just kind of the same I really don't wanna do this but.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, and were you able to do it? Did it make the difference to actually have this time schedule?\nYOLANDA: I don't-- I didn't follow the time -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh, you didn't.\nYOLANDA: - schedule actually it's kinda like started it and stop it or something, or I don't know.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: And then I didn't exactly follow the time exactly.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. All right. So but nothing particularly came out that. Like in terms of the thoughts so, sort of.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So let, let's take this, this one cuz I think this is not a bad, bad situation to work through. And what I wanted to do is that talk about so just hang on to that cuz we’ll, we’ll wanna use it. Talk about the way that we can answer these thoughts that, uhm, we talked last time about distortions -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - This idea about distortions in that, ah, negative thoughts can sometimes be accurate and sometime it's not. All right, you know, that, ah, and when they're accurate usually they're more tied to the events or the facts of the situation. And when they're distorted they tend to more be driven by our core beliefs or our general ways of what thinking about things remember that discussion?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: So that's why I wanted to tell you about today. So, what actually have here is a new form it's the, it's the same form as you've already got there to sort of extends a little bit. So stats with the thought situation of the thought the emotions of behaviors. So, you’ve seen all of this before.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: But then it takes it a little bit further and has a several columns for you to try to potentially, uhm, see whether not the thoughts can be changed. And if they can be changed often the consequences are that you can in either feel less of distressed or do something more adaptive. So actually engaging something more positive. Uhm, so this is the idea. So the, the question though that we want to look at this how do you deal these thoughts? So what are the-- is there a cognitive distortion involved in this particular automatic thought? Is there another-- other alternative thought that might be possible in the situation and if you can have this automatic thoughts or-- sorry, alternative thought instead how would you feel and behave? Ah, so what was, what was your original what, what would be the alternative consequence of it.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So let's look at that situation you, you got that. So I'll just put down shopping cuz we know what that, we'll know what the situation was from tonight. First automatic thought was cheap greedy people. Right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. And that make you feel angry 40%. And you chose not to buy. All right. So that was the behavioral outcome. Not all of that and but as part of that, okay? So the first was cheap greedy people na-- and if you look at the list of cognitive distortion, you have that? Let's take the look.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, are any of these da-- as you look at this and you look at this statement this automatic thought, do any of these come to mind as candidates as of kind of a distortion that you might have been using?\nYOLANDA: Hmm. Possibly mind reading.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Tell me about that. How, how might you have been mind reading.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I'm assuming I know why or what the motivation is.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. Yeah. You, you're assuming that they're cheap and greedy.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, which may be true. But do you know that?.\nYOLANDA: Not for fact.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: No. Okay. So, so you are potentially mind reading. So that thought might be distorted but it might not.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And we, we don't, we don't what's the bottom line we don't know have enough information. Another candidate is a possible distortion.\nYOLANDA: I'm looking at over generalreza-- over generalization.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Over gerneraliza-- okay. So tell me about that how might that be, ah, operating here?\nYOLANDA: It's I'm drawing a conclusion or, you know, uhm, I'm drawing-- I'm making a conclusion base on one event or, you know -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: - this one this one day of -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: - shopping.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, okay. So if that's a possible candidate, yeah. Yeah. You said that might be again, ah, a distortion that you're using. Can you think of any others?\nYOLANDA: Labeling.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. that, that, that one is pretty clear, isn't it?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Pretty much.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah. You, you definitely are labeling the store owners as being cheap and greedy. Right. So now we use labels like that, that's that process. So there's a couple of candidates here that maybe you were using one pretty sure you, you probably -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - wanna using that. Okay. So the question then is what you do with this, you know, if, if these are possible distortions how can you change them? Well there are three questions that we teach people to use to address them. So first, is what the evidence that supports or doesn't support each of these possible ways of thinking about things. Is there another alternative way to think about the situation? So, now I want you to look at the evidence and what you know and what you don't know and whether not you might be distorting. Uhm, is there a different way a more healthy way to think about the situation. And the third question is what are the implications of having these kinds of thoughts and possibly doing this kinds of distortions? It's a little bit harder I'll, I'll explain it.\nYOLANDA: Uhm-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Ah, it's basically, uhm,-- if it was true that this cognitive distor-- or this negative thought was actually valid. So let's assume that you look at the evidence and it's not clear-- or let's say the evidence even support that they are cheap and greedy people. Let's say you look at the alternatives and you don't find any reasonable alternatives. Right, that the negative thought really seems to be warranted. Do you still have to feel badly about it, ah, what are the implications of this thought being true? Do you have to be angry basically, in this particular case. Or is there some other way you could react to that? The, the other way I sometimes talk about it with people as well so what, and so what if they are cheap and greedy people you have to get upset about it. All right? So that, that's the kind of question that we can talk about and both will work through that in a second. Okay? So let's go back and look at this then. So cheap and greedy people, uhm, possibly mind reading, possibly in over generalization, possibly labeling. So let's take it back, what's the evidence? What's the evidence that these are cheap and greedy people?\nYOLANDA: Ah, the only evidence I have is their store policy.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, so there is some evidence, you know, the store policy about the $25 and the -\nYOLANDA: Not been able to handle to handle -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - not been able to...\nYOLANDA: - the merchandise.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Ah, is there any evidence that doesn't support the idea that they are cheap and greedy people?\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Cuz again, you wanna look at this in a balanced way. So what's the evidence for and against that particular thought?\nYOLANDA: I guess the evidence that they're not cheap and greedy people is that, uhm, the prices are I guess discounted.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So these are discounted prices that would, that, that would, that would se-- support if this is not being cheap and greedy in fact they're, they're offering a discount, they're offering more reasonable prices.\nYOLANDA: And that's why we went there in the first place.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh, really. Okay. All right. So that was your understanding.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, is there any other reason why somebody might have a policy about the $25 or like the credit card purchase?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: They charge what, $25?\nYOLANDA: They'll like, they'll like, uhm, I'm gonna ring up the order or purchase a certain amount anyway.\nYOLANDA: Ah, initially or something.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like regardless of how much the money is anyway. Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So then for them to ensure they've had at least $25 maybe makes it more cost effective for them?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So it might be a good business.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Was like a business decision now.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, and was it something that they only did to you like when you walk in the store do they come over to tell you that it's, you know, $25 maximum for you?\nYOLANDA: No. I think it was-- I just think it was their general policy.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, so-- okay. So, so it wasn't directed toward you personally it sound like a general policy, how about touching the merchandise? Was there a sign up or...\nYOLANDA: No. There wasn't a sign up?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, how did you know about not touching things?\nYOLANDA: Ah, clerk came over -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - and told us that, ah, he would bring the, the merchandise to us.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So it wasn't like you aren't allowed to touch it or, or look at it it's just that they'd want you going through and touching it the wanted to handle it?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I mean he said, you we don't-- in so many words he said, \"We don't allow people to, to touch the merchandise. If there is something you want we bring it you.\"\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Okay. And did you see them do that for anybody else?\nYOLANDA: Uhm-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Well, you probably looking around in particular. Okay. So already starting to look at some alternatives and so, so the evidence that support the cheap and greedy there is some, right? You know, the way that they handle the money and being strict about it. Uhm, it's also possible that, you know, maybe it's just business practice.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, you're right that you don't know their mind, right? And you don't know what their motivation was and, ah, sounds like it was not just you it's everybody got the same kind of handling. Uhm, it sounds like in terms of alternatives as possible that one of the reasons I do this is because it's the business practice it's not, ah, it's not being cheap and greedy per se, but it’s just the way of handling money and, you know, me-- maybe reducing the costs\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - you know, their charges. Uhm, and it's sound like they did give you access to the merchandise but just not, ah, not though you touching it.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. They didn't allow me to like look at the different, the assortment. I had to tell them which -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Which things.\nYOLANDA: - which color I wanted so they could bring it to me cuz they don't have all the colors on display.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Kind of the different way of doing business, right? Were these, were these small stores?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So they did not have enough room to put everything out?\nYOLANDA: Cuz they had so much stuff in the store just different, ah, degrees and different items -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - on display, so, yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, okay. So, so there are possibly some alternatives here -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - dah-- we-- you know, different ways of thinking in what the situation which maybe aren't quite as negative and aren't quite as support of this original cheap and, and greedy people idea. So, when you think about this thought and after the discussion we just had, can you think of a different way that you might have had that thought. Another way you might respond to that thought. That fits the facts well and maybe isn't a cognitive distortion or wouldn't be distorted.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, that their great entrepreneurs.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Now maybe you're being too generous the other way, right?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Ah...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. I, I don't want you to be overly positive in it -\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and really what', what's the realistic thought that fits the facts but that, you know, hopefully isn't distorted in a negative way.\nYOLANDA: I mean that they're doing, they're doing business. They're in it to make money and, uhm, they're looking out for their, their, you know best interest.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So they are looking at for the best interest.\nYOLANDA: And at the same time if they get someone to spend more than $12, uhm, when I guess, you know, it make sense it's in their best interest to do that -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: - to say we have this limit you got to spend at least $25 -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. So that -\nYOLANDA: - to use this credit card.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - so, so the policy is to their best interest.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, again which fits with the idea about they're doing business and looking out for their own interests, right. Their policies are in their own best interest, okay. So now if we look at these alternative thoughts that we you just generated so they're doing business they are looking out for their own best interest the policy is in their own best interest. Is that seem factual?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: I mean is it balance, is it too positive do you think? Is that cutting them too much slack?\nYOLANDA: I don't know if this kinda, uhm, too much slack, I mean-- I think that's probably first and foremost.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: For them?\nYOLANDA: Uh-uhm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Okay. Uhm, does it fit the facts better than the idea that their cheap and greedy people.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, alright. If you had have these thoughts at the time so, you know, they told you the policy, they told you, you can't touch merchandise and you had these thoughts and then go they're doing business, they're looking at for their own best interest. How angry do you think you would have felt?\nYOLANDA: Ah, probably not so much. It ju-- I, I think I would have-- they would have been an understanding.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I would have known, \"Okay, this is what I'm going into. This people are trying to make money and, uhm, I might come up on the short end of the stick because they're trying to make money.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah. But, ah, so again just to be concrete you said originally you are be feeling about 40% anger. Any idea what, what it might have in other ways.\nYOLANDA: I might have been-- I still might have been irritated but maybe 20%.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So it might not have been with anger, it might have been irritation.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: You know again, the truth is we often don't know what the facts are with e-- in fact that's possible they are cheap and greedy people. Right? You know, that-- you know, this is just one manifestation and one way that they show and they do it another ways too but we don't know that, uhm, so the evidence really, you know, could have been interpreted differently and, and you said some more reasonable alternatives are these and if you thought those ways you might have felt some irritation, little bit of anger maybe some understanding. Right? So you probably wouldn't have had the same kind of negative reaction. Do you think you might have shopped?\nYOLANDA: It's possible.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah. My, my guess is what I would have done is you would have put the control back on your hands now -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Where, where you have said, \"Now there something I really want.\"\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: \"It is something I think is worth $25.\" Or not and it wouldn't be that you didn't buy because you are angry with them, right? So it would have been again more of a personal choice rather than the reaction to the negative thoughts and feelings.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Yeah, it does.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So let's look at the other part of it you'd said also it was the sadness part for this and I wanna get to that. So what is the thought that drove that?\nYOLANDA: Ah, \"Am I not good enough?\"\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Am I not good enough? And you wrote sadness and it was, ah, 40? Yeah. Forty. And was there behavior tied to that or is it just again the same not buying?\nYOLANDA: I think I kinda shrugged that one off.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay so you didn't do it much of that behaviorally. So look at this. So, so this is a question we-- you'd put it, \"Am I not good enough?\" Are there are any possible let’s look at the list the distortions. Are there any possible distortions here.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, all or nothing thinking comes, ah...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, okay, okay, tell me that about how, how might that apply?\nYOLANDA: I’ve been thinking that am not good enough I guess I'm either thinking I am good enough or I'm not good enough.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah.\nYOLANDA: There is no in between.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. So not good enough to employs it sort of a categorical decision, right? Not good enough, good enough. Right? Sure that's a possibility. Okay?\nYOLANDA: Uhm. Again, some mind reading is going on.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm, how, how is that?\nYOLANDA: Because I'm, I'm thinking that I know that they're thinking I'm not good enough for...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. Right. Exactly, yeah. So you're basing it on your perception and what do you think they think about you which may or may not be true.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Right. Okay. Okay. Any candidates?\nYOLANDA: I'm looking at this disqualifying the positive, uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, certainly it's a focus on the negative here, you know -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - not right so. It may be that hard, hard to know yeah.\nYOLANDA: Somewhat to negative tunnel vision.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Is tunnel vision down here?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Well tunnel vision is the same idea sort to mag-- magnifying or, or focusing out go-- going up to negative -\nYOLANDA: Okay. Negative.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - minimizing a positive or disqualifying the positive.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: The one I was wondering about, was over generalizing like again we, we -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - we say not good enough and, again it's not clear if you mean not good enough to shop or you mean not good enough as a person. With the way I hear the thought it's more like am I not good enough as a person.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Is that, is that true?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Is that the way we put it? Yeah. So then it may be some over generalization as well. But not dramatically. Right? And again the goal here isn't, ah, you know sort to just namely to distortions and say, how you forget your problems and, and now we can just get rid of them. But, you know, don't look at thoughts more realistically so, so again, \"Am I not good enough?\" So the situation was, you know, think they're having these thoughts about they're judging you and it raises for you the idea that you should judge yourself. And you question whether you should judge yourself and you feel some sadness because of that. Ah, is there any evidence to support this idea again that you're not good enough here in this moment? And if we go back to the three questions for what's the evidence that either support or doesn't support those particular thought.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I don't know what the evidence would be in this instance.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nYOLANDA: The only thing I can think of is not having enough cash even I did actually did have some cash on me I just didn't wanna, didn't wanna use my cash.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I can't think of any others.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, so in this particular case there may not be much evidence that either does support or doesn't support that. And, and your thought well that was that if they will making that judgment of you then it sort of raises in your mind. So what's the evidence that supports the idea they were judging you?\nYOLANDA: Hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Or doesn't, or doesn't support the idea they were judging you.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I know I felt judged when I wasn't able to handle the merchandise.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, this is just like why can I handle the informa-- ah, the merchandise that I'm potentially going to buy.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Sure. And how did you answer that question when, when you had the thought, \"Why can't I?\" It's because?\nYOLANDA: Well initially I thought I attributed it to them.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. But, ah, they were making a judgment about you -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - right exactly. That maybe they thought you didn't have the money or you didn't, you know, you were black and they didn't wanna sell to you particularly.\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right? So, so some kind of a thought like popped up in your head, that they were judging you again.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. So, so in general I would say, Yolanda that if you get this question about why is this happening or, or why, why anything like, why won’t the sell to me or whatever, why can't I touch the merchandise. Usually we don't get the distressed unless we actually have an answer to those questions in our own hand.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And if it's just a question and usually we don't get, ah, we don't get sad or angry or whatever it’s when we think we know the answer then we get angry or so.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: Well, well it just like if somebody let's say even if we, we imagine the worst case that somebody actually made a negative statement about you.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. Do you have to have this thought that you're not good enough? Does, does one necessarily have to leave to the other conclusion? This kind of all or nothing thinking that I must better enough because somebody thinks poorly of me.\nYOLANDA: You know, I don't know, it doesn't necessarily have to-- I hope not.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah, ah, I-- yeah. So, so again are there some positive, is there some positive evidence that you can draw that you are good enough or you are a good person?\nYOLANDA: Sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So again you can think of some-- can you say something that good\nYOLANDA: I, I maybe I'm thinking too much on this particular situation. I don't know, uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, so is there some evidence that doesn't support this idea that you're not good enough?\nYOLANDA: Sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah, yeah. And we probably got lots of it right from your life and from the-- to find the way you behave you schooling and...\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Right. You just got a job offer -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that's-- there’s, there’s lots of evidence you could probably drop. So, so when you go this thought, you know, \"Am I not good enough?\" And use your, your assumption was well this must be true and you know to be self-critical but in fact if you look at the evidence that refutes this, there some on the other side too, okay? So we’re looking at the evidence primarily let's think then about well, what are some alternatives then? If there are some possibly some distortions and you weren't looking or sort of thinking while this in a balance way what might be a more balance more fact fitting. You know, accurate way of thinking about this situation instead of, \"Am I not good enough?\"\nYOLANDA: I am good enough. I'm good as any other person -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - shopping, ah, in their stores. Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm. I'm as good as anyone else here. Yeah. Okay. Uhm, maybe the problem isn't with you, maybe the problem is with them.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. So, and again we don't know that. We don't know that, we don't wanna mind read but maybe they have a problem or a bias. Or we, we don't know. Again, maybe they're just being business, you know, bloody minded business people -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and it just wanna make us much money as they can, right? So, so they're not caring what other people's feeling they're just looking at the bottom line.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Possible? Right? So we don't know. I gue-- I guess it's part of it in this particular case we don't really know what their thoughts were but all this is predicated on your idea about what they thought about you.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And that you jump to this conclusion that and maybe you're not good enough. If you were able to think about it like this at, at the moment, \"I'm as good as anyone else here, maybe they have a problem.\" How much sadness do you think you might have felt?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, 10% if even.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So 10% or less. Okay. So, so pretty much it drops drops down, right? Okay. So-- and there's anything else come up? There's any other fe-- feeling pop-up? \"I'm as good as anyone else, maybe they have a problem.\"\nYOLANDA: No, not right away.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: No? Okay. Some, sometimes people when they, they look at situations, you know, looking in terms of the evidence and the alternatives in fact some positive feelings pop-up so maybe not. But like for example, \"I'm as good as anyone else here\", you might say pride, you know.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Then-- but you, you may not feel that way, so that's fine. Okay. So we've have just taken a couple of the thoughts. You actually had several thoughts in the situation, what I wanted to do is use a couple of them as example is to show you how you can look for evidence again, you know, are these distorted potentially or not, look at the evidence, look at the alternatives and then see if you can come up with them ore balanced or reasonable alternatively of thinking about this situation and you see what happen of course in both cases if, if you could have done that you probably would have been feeling less angry and less sad.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right? And maybe you might have had some positive feelings they understanding and maybe a little bit of pride or a little sense of, you know, indignation, you know, proper indignation that I'm just as good anybody else here. All right? So let's kinda take the edge off of the negative feelings -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - e-- and opens up the possibility of this that you might actually start to feel better about yourself. That make sense?\nYOLANDA: It does.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Now, again if you were feeling less angry, less irritated, less sad and maybe a bit of pride, again do you think the behavior could have changed.\nYOLANDA: It's possible.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah it’s possible. I, I think what it does is it opens up the chance at least again for you then to make the decision about what we want to do based on your own best interest rather maybe than similar negative thoughts and the negative feelings. All right?\nYOLANDA: Yeaah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah? That make sense?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, does this sound like a useful framework for thinking about thoughts?\nYOLANDA: It does. It sounds like they can get a little-- I don't wanna say tricky but involve.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm, as of sound like that.\nYOLANDA: I guess, when you start thinking about, maybe not so much what is the evidence but I mean really considering the alternatives -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: It sounds like it, it get kind of involves like-- and maybe because if you're so use to thinking one way -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and then you kinda training yourself to think or consider something else.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: That's right.\nYOLANDA: I think it, I think it can be little, little challenging.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. It's try-- it's trying to move you off, off the automatic thoughts that habitual patterns that a thought that you have and just sort of stopping in questioning yourself. And maybe at the end of it in fact that you come away with the idea that, you know they are cheap greedy people but the evidence really does support this and, and that's true. You know, in which case then in fact changing your thoughts isn't going to help that what you had need to do then is figuring out some strategy for dealing with cheap and greedy people.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: Yeah. Right? And rather than reacting to things -\nYOLANDA: All right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - emotionally you can think about what's your best interest.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Make sense?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, so what I would like to propose for homework is that you practice this exercise like not just the, the first columns but the whole exercise the best we can when some situation pop-up.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Does sound possible? Okay.\nYOLANDA: I will do my best.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Yeah-- well, you're, you're doing great. I mean, you know, I don't, I don't know how hard this is for your but, you know, I mean what you're writing down is exactly the kind of work that I'd like to see. Does feel, is this make sense though?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: It make sense.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Now the one thing we haven't talk toward so much is this last question, this little white question. And that's actually little bit trickier and, and normally when I work with people I don't talk too much about that, the first time I introduce this -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - like first I think if you can get looking at these first two questions that's a good start. And what I propose is that and again I'm hoping we'll have another session but, that when we have the next session you can then see how well you're doing with these two questions and then we can come back to this a little bit. All right? But this question, ah, just, just very briefly what it leads to is the idea that, uhm, for example let's say that the evidence really supported the idea that you're not good enough that you're failing in some way. That you, you know, that there's something wrong with or cuz something like that. Or what would that mean? Is that mean you still have to be sad and that you still have to not shop or you have to withdraw?\nYOLANDA: No.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Not necessarily, right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: But I, but I think it's a little bit harder to answer that question -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - if, if we look at the evidence and look at the alternatives and it's really tough to do anything different than the original negative thought. But, but that's why I like to look at that a little bit later. So, once you got this first three down a little bit more.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay? So, ah, again I hope we get there next time, ah, if not what I will do is I'll certainly way out some, some more description how is this can be done -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - this, this kind of work. And, ah, then you'll be able to work on that either by yourself or maybe with another counselor. That make sense?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, I give you that and this actually some more here, some more sheets so I'll give you many sheets or you can have them all. So there's lots of opportunities here if you have lots of negative thoughts.\nYOLANDA: No.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: No. No, seriously, just as many as are appropriate you can, you can do.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So we had a chance then to work through those thoughts. We look at the situation you, you got another continuing kind of assignment which builds on what we've been doing, any reactions overall?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I mean I like the idea that, ah, it sounds like I'm being empowered like I don't have to think, you know, this automatic thoughts like-- I mean I have a choice -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm, exactly.\nYOLANDA: - and I don't have to like you were saying I don’t have to respond to, you know, this automatic thoughts I'm happen-- ah, that I'm having I can actually, you know, I can choose -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - uhm,-- I mean cuz it can feel like it's ha-- it's happening so naturally that, you know, it just I guess you can feel like it is, uhm, I don't wanna say taking over but it just happens so naturally.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Eh-- eh-- anyway-- but it anyway it does. And in fact often when you have this automatic thoughts and you just act as if they're true -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - they'll almost become self-fulfilling.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right? Yeah.\nYOLANDA: So I like the idea of, you know me being in control.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, and then, ah, like I was saying the challenge is really considering the alternative thought -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: - because like there's a such a pattern of in a way of thinking that you just don't even consider that there might be an alternative.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Ah, absolutely right. And, and if we again-- and if we have more sessions what we can do is we can actually over time and look these patterns of the original automatic thoughts and we can actually track them back to your core beliefs.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Cuz a lot of them pop-up not just because of the situation and they're, they're almost from the situational -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - but they almost always will have some kind of tie into your core beliefs -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like the feeling of not being good enough we've talked about before. All right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: As one of the ones and so here's the situation in where that pops up again. So, of course because you carry around this general beliefs they’re going to tend to pop-up in different situations. Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. So part of the idea here is breaking those patters giving you a chance to stop and look at them and evaluate them, you know, and decide if they fit the facts or not and if not to change them, that’s right andgive you more power to do that. All right? So this is part of the process again this, this takes time.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: You know, you know, you’ve had years of working with your automatic thoughts -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and not questioning them. So it takes a while to learn to stop and, and look at the facts. So, so it's not easy, okay? But you've got a great, you've got a good response, yeah. Good.

DOBSON: Hi, ah, welcome back. Ah, so this our fourth appointment so I'm moving along. So, glad we could both get here I know I just rushed in myself so, so a little, little bit scattered feeling myself right now but are you doing okay?\nYOLANDA: I'm doing okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. That's good. Ah, I know we had some homework and I ca-- I can see you're-- you've got it there. So we wanna get to that of course. Uhm, I always wanna start of course find out if there's anything else we need to talk about tonight. Any, any crises that happen in the past week or nay other issues?\nYOLANDA: No crises, ah, new development I actually, ah, gotta call on yesterday about a job\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - that they want me to start tomorrow.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm. Okay.\nYOLANDA: So, uhm, it’s gonna interfere with, ah, our appointments -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - unfortunately. And I was trying to work something out but I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do that.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, so just to be clear this job starts like immediately?\nYOLANDA: Yes.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And when does it have, like for how long is the day or...\nYOLANDA: Uhm, do you mean the hours that I'll be working?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah. Uhm-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Ah, 8:30 to five.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So that would, that would-- that would definitely make it difficult to come here for four o'clock, okay. Uhm, so what, what do you want to do and what your propose. Have you asked them about any possibility of, ah, getting away cuz our next appointment again had been plan for two weeks from tonight.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And then the one after that three weeks down the road from that. So I don't if, I don't know if that be possible to get permission to, ah, come for physicians appointment or doctor's appointment.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, well I can find out cuz I don't, uhm, I've not meet like who my supervisor is -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - or, uhm, I don't have any of that information yet -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - cuz the site it's totally new site and they're hiring people, you know, brand new or whatever so, uhm, if I go in tomorrow maybe get a feel for things, uhm, I'm even interested in working a different shift.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: So if I can get some information about possibly working a different shift or something -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - it might be doable.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So-- okay, so we definitely need to figure this out before, before you leave tonight. Okay. And you said there were no other crises this week. All right. Uhm, so we wanted to work on this and, ah, I'd said last week that we wanted to talk more tonight on how to work with negative thoughts -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - how you kinda answer them. And so I'd like to do that tonight if we, if we can anyway, ah, cuz I like you to have that sort of, ah, you know, we have that discussion.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, I guess I’m not quite sure how to, how to proceed though cuz I also said I know that one of the things I want to do is to by the end of our time give you sort of a plan for future -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - future therapy. So, ah, of course I haven't cut out prepared for tonight. I didn't anticipate the discussion. So, uhm, Well why, why don't we proceed on the basis that, ah, for the time being we'll just assume that the next appointment is okay.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: If it's not, if you need to cancel it or if you need to, to change it, ah, cuz I'll be coming back again that, that last time after the sixth appoint, ah, you might be able to make one of those two times.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And then we could have that as our final appointment or if they can make the change and you can get here and we can just carry on as normal.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: For you would that be okay?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And then what, what you can get is maybe contact the people here and then they can send the message to me so that I know whether you'd be coming back or not.\nYOLANDA: All right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And what I would do in any event, ah, if tonight is our last appointment, I'll write out, uhm, some recommendations anyway and I'll send them through the people here to you.\nYOLANDA: Okay. All right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, and if I can see you again that will be great and we, we can do it in person.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Does that make sense? Uhm, probably about the best we can do, right? Depen-- depending on the work, I mean the work is probably more important, right then, then coming here in some ways I'm thinking, I'm guessing.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Well, I'm here in terms of finances, sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Sure, yeah, yeah, that's important. Yeah. Okay. Ah, so that would be a reasonable way to handle that?\nYOLANDA: Sounds like it.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. All right. So then we'll just, uhm, assume how I'll assume that we'll see you again. I'll see you again and if not and that's unfortunate but hopefully I will be able to. But at the very least I’ll send you the written document.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, great. All right. So then why don't you tell me little bit about what your discover at the homework and, then we can take that maybe as a jumping point to talk about the other homework. Cuz there, there's a part of the session.\nYOLANDA: Okay. Uhm, so over the weekend, I went shopping with friends and, ah, we were going in and out to these different shops. And -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - I was gonna buy a hat and scarf set we-- I was gonna use, ah, my credit card -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and all of the shops had this rule where you had to spend at least $25.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And then they were kind of...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: You mean, to use your credit card?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: And then, they really didn't want to handle the merchandise like they don't want you to kind of I guess browse or look through it or and that it made me kind of angry, uhm, about the situation and I just ha-- I guess I, I categorize the merchants as cheap and greedy in. And then I felt like I was being discriminated against and, uhm, I don't know I was kinda wanna like, you know, like what is the big deal like am I not good enough for, you know -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - just so it was a few different things going on.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: That good, that, that good enough idea popped up again?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. And I felt like, you know like why is-- why the hassle, you know -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm, uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - what so-- uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So it's this. So this is good example so it's, ah, an e-- a sadness, it’s a more, yes. So I can see it actually you've written down a lot of anger here. In fact you are done anger twice.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Again, related each of this thoughts?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - where they sell like handbags or jewelry and stuff like that.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, so your first thought was they’re being cheap and greedy. So what I'm guessing that, that-- again before you can have this you probably had a, you noticed something. So did they have a sign up that said $25 or did somebody come and tell you this?\nYOLANDA: I went to the register to purchase the hat and scarf and that's when, ah, clerk told me and then I started to notice that about every store, every store has the same policy.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Okay. So this was the thought that sort to start, sort to crept up on the on you as you went out through the different stores. Okay. And what's this discrimination idea and being discriminated against?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, at the. It has a lot to do what this st-- the stores were mostly are owned or run by a certain particular persuasion of people and I guess the history of, ah, relationships between my culture and their cultures -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - is little tense.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. When, when you say culture, do you mean colors?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Skin color black?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, so these are Whites people -\nYOLANDA: No.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - people that around you?\nYOLANDA: No. They weren't White people, they were Asian people.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Asian people. Okay. And but you think that they were discriminating against you because of your skin color?\nYOLANDA: You know, it's that's kinda...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: This is, this is the thought they come on?\nYOLANDA: It is, it is the thought that comes to mind it just in relation to past, ah, -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - incidents and stuff it-- it did that thought come to mine.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. And you also you had you've heard in here as a question, \"Am I not good enough?\" Did, uhm,-- so, so you-- you're right, I think what you're asking here is really, \"Am I not good enough for them?\" Is, is that fair enough or, or was it a thought that -\nYOLANDA: Or to be, or to be respect...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - or is it that you thought about yourself?\nYOLANDA: Well, it’s more on relation to, to them like -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - you know, I'm shopping in your store, you know -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - was-- you know, why I can't I be respected as a consumer, you know?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, yeah, I'm guess I'm asking the more to understand whether not this was a thought you had about the way they might have been thinking about you or whether not this was a thought you had about yourself.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like the way that you noted yourself in terms of being good enough.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Cuz you written down sadness here as the emotion and usually when I see that sadness is something that we direct towards yourself.\nYOLANDA: I'll say a, a little bit of both.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, so partly about them and then part the question again, \"Am I not good enough make myself there?\" So can-- so I just written down the same way.\nYOLANDA: Sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Often times when people have these kinds of thoughts the questions, \"Am I not good enough?\" In fact you have the answer as well.\nYOLANDA: Hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right? And so, so we ask ourselves this rhetorical questions like, \"Why this does happen to me?\" Or, \"Am I not good enough?\"\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: But often we-- ourselves have an answer to that. Is-- I don't know if you had have thought of an answer to that thought yourself.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like for example, you know, the thought, \"Am I not good enough for them\", would you go so far as to say something, \"I'm not good enough for them? or they don't think I'm good enough?\"\nYOLANDA: I must say, \"They don't think I'm good enough.\"\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. Okay. So, so that one-- we have actually a more definitive kind of answer to it. This one am I not good enough for myself. And would you go so far to say something like, \"I'm, I'm not good enough for myself?\" Or, \"I question my value?\" Or...\nYOLANDA: Yeah, I might say, \"I question my value.\"\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So and that and literally that's what you're doing here.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, okay. So and it sounds like when you do that that's more tied to sadness. When you think about them it's more tied to anger.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Is that fair?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: In fact that's all to what we find is that when you have negative thoughts about other people like these ones -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - you tend to see more anger as an emotional reaction. Sadness tends to be something that we direct more towards ourselves. So, so this is a great one, okay then you ended up not spending money in any of the shops. So, it's kinda like was it a protest thing?\nYOLANDA: Yes.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah?\nYOLANDA: Yes.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like if this is why you're gonna treat me I just when I'm kinda give you my money?\nYOLANDA: Pretty much.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Fair enough, fair enough. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uhm, oh this, this was part of the, the homework?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: The, the reflection. So nothing popped up particularly for that?\nYOLANDA: No. Just kind of the same I really don't wanna do this but.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, and were you able to do it? Did it make the difference to actually have this time schedule?\nYOLANDA: I don't-- I didn't follow the time -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh, you didn't.\nYOLANDA: - schedule actually it's kinda like started it and stop it or something, or I don't know.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: And then I didn't exactly follow the time exactly.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. All right. So but nothing particularly came out that. Like in terms of the thoughts so, sort of.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So let, let's take this, this one cuz I think this is not a bad, bad situation to work through. And what I wanted to do is that talk about so just hang on to that cuz we’ll, we’ll wanna use it. Talk about the way that we can answer these thoughts that, uhm, we talked last time about distortions -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - This idea about distortions in that, ah, negative thoughts can sometimes be accurate and sometime it's not. All right, you know, that, ah, and when they're accurate usually they're more tied to the events or the facts of the situation. And when they're distorted they tend to more be driven by our core beliefs or our general ways of what thinking about things remember that discussion?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: So that's why I wanted to tell you about today. So, what actually have here is a new form it's the, it's the same form as you've already got there to sort of extends a little bit. So stats with the thought situation of the thought the emotions of behaviors. So, you’ve seen all of this before.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: But then it takes it a little bit further and has a several columns for you to try to potentially, uhm, see whether not the thoughts can be changed. And if they can be changed often the consequences are that you can in either feel less of distressed or do something more adaptive. So actually engaging something more positive. Uhm, so this is the idea. So the, the question though that we want to look at this how do you deal these thoughts? So what are the-- is there a cognitive distortion involved in this particular automatic thought? Is there another-- other alternative thought that might be possible in the situation and if you can have this automatic thoughts or-- sorry, alternative thought instead how would you feel and behave? Ah, so what was, what was your original what, what would be the alternative consequence of it.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So let's look at that situation you, you got that. So I'll just put down shopping cuz we know what that, we'll know what the situation was from tonight. First automatic thought was cheap greedy people. Right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. And that make you feel angry 40%. And you chose not to buy. All right. So that was the behavioral outcome. Not all of that and but as part of that, okay? So the first was cheap greedy people na-- and if you look at the list of cognitive distortion, you have that? Let's take the look.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, are any of these da-- as you look at this and you look at this statement this automatic thought, do any of these come to mind as candidates as of kind of a distortion that you might have been using?\nYOLANDA: Hmm. Possibly mind reading.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Tell me about that. How, how might you have been mind reading.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I'm assuming I know why or what the motivation is.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. Yeah. You, you're assuming that they're cheap and greedy.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, which may be true. But do you know that?.\nYOLANDA: Not for fact.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: No. Okay. So, so you are potentially mind reading. So that thought might be distorted but it might not.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And we, we don't, we don't what's the bottom line we don't know have enough information. Another candidate is a possible distortion.\nYOLANDA: I'm looking at over generalreza-- over generalization.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Over gerneraliza-- okay. So tell me about that how might that be, ah, operating here?\nYOLANDA: It's I'm drawing a conclusion or, you know, uhm, I'm drawing-- I'm making a conclusion base on one event or, you know -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: - this one this one day of -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: - shopping.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, okay. So if that's a possible candidate, yeah. Yeah. You said that might be again, ah, a distortion that you're using. Can you think of any others?\nYOLANDA: Labeling.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. that, that, that one is pretty clear, isn't it?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Pretty much.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah. You, you definitely are labeling the store owners as being cheap and greedy. Right. So now we use labels like that, that's that process. So there's a couple of candidates here that maybe you were using one pretty sure you, you probably -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - wanna using that. Okay. So the question then is what you do with this, you know, if, if these are possible distortions how can you change them? Well there are three questions that we teach people to use to address them. So first, is what the evidence that supports or doesn't support each of these possible ways of thinking about things. Is there another alternative way to think about the situation? So, now I want you to look at the evidence and what you know and what you don't know and whether not you might be distorting. Uhm, is there a different way a more healthy way to think about the situation. And the third question is what are the implications of having these kinds of thoughts and possibly doing this kinds of distortions? It's a little bit harder I'll, I'll explain it.\nYOLANDA: Uhm-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Ah, it's basically, uhm,-- if it was true that this cognitive distor-- or this negative thought was actually valid. So let's assume that you look at the evidence and it's not clear-- or let's say the evidence even support that they are cheap and greedy people. Let's say you look at the alternatives and you don't find any reasonable alternatives. Right, that the negative thought really seems to be warranted. Do you still have to feel badly about it, ah, what are the implications of this thought being true? Do you have to be angry basically, in this particular case. Or is there some other way you could react to that? The, the other way I sometimes talk about it with people as well so what, and so what if they are cheap and greedy people you have to get upset about it. All right? So that, that's the kind of question that we can talk about and both will work through that in a second. Okay? So let's go back and look at this then. So cheap and greedy people, uhm, possibly mind reading, possibly in over generalization, possibly labeling. So let's take it back, what's the evidence? What's the evidence that these are cheap and greedy people?\nYOLANDA: Ah, the only evidence I have is their store policy.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, so there is some evidence, you know, the store policy about the $25 and the -\nYOLANDA: Not been able to handle to handle -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - not been able to...\nYOLANDA: - the merchandise.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Ah, is there any evidence that doesn't support the idea that they are cheap and greedy people?\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Cuz again, you wanna look at this in a balanced way. So what's the evidence for and against that particular thought?\nYOLANDA: I guess the evidence that they're not cheap and greedy people is that, uhm, the prices are I guess discounted.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So these are discounted prices that would, that, that would, that would se-- support if this is not being cheap and greedy in fact they're, they're offering a discount, they're offering more reasonable prices.\nYOLANDA: And that's why we went there in the first place.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Oh, really. Okay. All right. So that was your understanding.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, is there any other reason why somebody might have a policy about the $25 or like the credit card purchase?\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: They charge what, $25?\nYOLANDA: They'll like, they'll like, uhm, I'm gonna ring up the order or purchase a certain amount anyway.\nYOLANDA: Ah, initially or something.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like regardless of how much the money is anyway. Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So then for them to ensure they've had at least $25 maybe makes it more cost effective for them?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So it might be a good business.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Was like a business decision now.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, and was it something that they only did to you like when you walk in the store do they come over to tell you that it's, you know, $25 maximum for you?\nYOLANDA: No. I think it was-- I just think it was their general policy.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, so-- okay. So, so it wasn't directed toward you personally it sound like a general policy, how about touching the merchandise? Was there a sign up or...\nYOLANDA: No. There wasn't a sign up?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, how did you know about not touching things?\nYOLANDA: Ah, clerk came over -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - and told us that, ah, he would bring the, the merchandise to us.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So it wasn't like you aren't allowed to touch it or, or look at it it's just that they'd want you going through and touching it the wanted to handle it?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. I mean he said, you we don't-- in so many words he said, \"We don't allow people to, to touch the merchandise. If there is something you want we bring it you.\"\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Okay. And did you see them do that for anybody else?\nYOLANDA: Uhm-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Well, you probably looking around in particular. Okay. So already starting to look at some alternatives and so, so the evidence that support the cheap and greedy there is some, right? You know, the way that they handle the money and being strict about it. Uhm, it's also possible that, you know, maybe it's just business practice.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, you're right that you don't know their mind, right? And you don't know what their motivation was and, ah, sounds like it was not just you it's everybody got the same kind of handling. Uhm, it sounds like in terms of alternatives as possible that one of the reasons I do this is because it's the business practice it's not, ah, it's not being cheap and greedy per se, but it’s just the way of handling money and, you know, me-- maybe reducing the costs\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - you know, their charges. Uhm, and it's sound like they did give you access to the merchandise but just not, ah, not though you touching it.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. They didn't allow me to like look at the different, the assortment. I had to tell them which -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Which things.\nYOLANDA: - which color I wanted so they could bring it to me cuz they don't have all the colors on display.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Kind of the different way of doing business, right? Were these, were these small stores?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So they did not have enough room to put everything out?\nYOLANDA: Cuz they had so much stuff in the store just different, ah, degrees and different items -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: - on display, so, yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, okay. So, so there are possibly some alternatives here -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - dah-- we-- you know, different ways of thinking in what the situation which maybe aren't quite as negative and aren't quite as support of this original cheap and, and greedy people idea. So, when you think about this thought and after the discussion we just had, can you think of a different way that you might have had that thought. Another way you might respond to that thought. That fits the facts well and maybe isn't a cognitive distortion or wouldn't be distorted.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, that their great entrepreneurs.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Now maybe you're being too generous the other way, right?\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Ah...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. I, I don't want you to be overly positive in it -\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and really what', what's the realistic thought that fits the facts but that, you know, hopefully isn't distorted in a negative way.\nYOLANDA: I mean that they're doing, they're doing business. They're in it to make money and, uhm, they're looking out for their, their, you know best interest.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So they are looking at for the best interest.\nYOLANDA: And at the same time if they get someone to spend more than $12, uhm, when I guess, you know, it make sense it's in their best interest to do that -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right.\nYOLANDA: - to say we have this limit you got to spend at least $25 -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. So that -\nYOLANDA: - to use this credit card.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - so, so the policy is to their best interest.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, again which fits with the idea about they're doing business and looking out for their own interests, right. Their policies are in their own best interest, okay. So now if we look at these alternative thoughts that we you just generated so they're doing business they are looking out for their own best interest the policy is in their own best interest. Is that seem factual?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: I mean is it balance, is it too positive do you think? Is that cutting them too much slack?\nYOLANDA: I don't know if this kinda, uhm, too much slack, I mean-- I think that's probably first and foremost.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: For them?\nYOLANDA: Uh-uhm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Okay. Uhm, does it fit the facts better than the idea that their cheap and greedy people.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay, alright. If you had have these thoughts at the time so, you know, they told you the policy, they told you, you can't touch merchandise and you had these thoughts and then go they're doing business, they're looking at for their own best interest. How angry do you think you would have felt?\nYOLANDA: Ah, probably not so much. It ju-- I, I think I would have-- they would have been an understanding.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: I would have known, \"Okay, this is what I'm going into. This people are trying to make money and, uhm, I might come up on the short end of the stick because they're trying to make money.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah. But, ah, so again just to be concrete you said originally you are be feeling about 40% anger. Any idea what, what it might have in other ways.\nYOLANDA: I might have been-- I still might have been irritated but maybe 20%.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So it might not have been with anger, it might have been irritation.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: You know again, the truth is we often don't know what the facts are with e-- in fact that's possible they are cheap and greedy people. Right? You know, that-- you know, this is just one manifestation and one way that they show and they do it another ways too but we don't know that, uhm, so the evidence really, you know, could have been interpreted differently and, and you said some more reasonable alternatives are these and if you thought those ways you might have felt some irritation, little bit of anger maybe some understanding. Right? So you probably wouldn't have had the same kind of negative reaction. Do you think you might have shopped?\nYOLANDA: It's possible.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah. My, my guess is what I would have done is you would have put the control back on your hands now -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Where, where you have said, \"Now there something I really want.\"\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: \"It is something I think is worth $25.\" Or not and it wouldn't be that you didn't buy because you are angry with them, right? So it would have been again more of a personal choice rather than the reaction to the negative thoughts and feelings.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Does that make sense?\nYOLANDA: Yeah, it does.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So let's look at the other part of it you'd said also it was the sadness part for this and I wanna get to that. So what is the thought that drove that?\nYOLANDA: Ah, \"Am I not good enough?\"\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Am I not good enough? And you wrote sadness and it was, ah, 40? Yeah. Forty. And was there behavior tied to that or is it just again the same not buying?\nYOLANDA: I think I kinda shrugged that one off.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay so you didn't do it much of that behaviorally. So look at this. So, so this is a question we-- you'd put it, \"Am I not good enough?\" Are there are any possible let’s look at the list the distortions. Are there any possible distortions here.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, all or nothing thinking comes, ah...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uhm, okay, okay, tell me that about how, how might that apply?\nYOLANDA: I’ve been thinking that am not good enough I guess I'm either thinking I am good enough or I'm not good enough.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah.\nYOLANDA: There is no in between.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. So not good enough to employs it sort of a categorical decision, right? Not good enough, good enough. Right? Sure that's a possibility. Okay?\nYOLANDA: Uhm. Again, some mind reading is going on.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm, how, how is that?\nYOLANDA: Because I'm, I'm thinking that I know that they're thinking I'm not good enough for...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. Right. Exactly, yeah. So you're basing it on your perception and what do you think they think about you which may or may not be true.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Right. Okay. Okay. Any candidates?\nYOLANDA: I'm looking at this disqualifying the positive, uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, certainly it's a focus on the negative here, you know -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - not right so. It may be that hard, hard to know yeah.\nYOLANDA: Somewhat to negative tunnel vision.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Is tunnel vision down here?\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Well tunnel vision is the same idea sort to mag-- magnifying or, or focusing out go-- going up to negative -\nYOLANDA: Okay. Negative.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - minimizing a positive or disqualifying the positive.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: The one I was wondering about, was over generalizing like again we, we -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - we say not good enough and, again it's not clear if you mean not good enough to shop or you mean not good enough as a person. With the way I hear the thought it's more like am I not good enough as a person.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Is that, is that true?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Is that the way we put it? Yeah. So then it may be some over generalization as well. But not dramatically. Right? And again the goal here isn't, ah, you know sort to just namely to distortions and say, how you forget your problems and, and now we can just get rid of them. But, you know, don't look at thoughts more realistically so, so again, \"Am I not good enough?\" So the situation was, you know, think they're having these thoughts about they're judging you and it raises for you the idea that you should judge yourself. And you question whether you should judge yourself and you feel some sadness because of that. Ah, is there any evidence to support this idea again that you're not good enough here in this moment? And if we go back to the three questions for what's the evidence that either support or doesn't support those particular thought.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I don't know what the evidence would be in this instance.\n[sil.]\n[SIL.]\nYOLANDA: The only thing I can think of is not having enough cash even I did actually did have some cash on me I just didn't wanna, didn't wanna use my cash.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I can't think of any others.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, so in this particular case there may not be much evidence that either does support or doesn't support that. And, and your thought well that was that if they will making that judgment of you then it sort of raises in your mind. So what's the evidence that supports the idea they were judging you?\nYOLANDA: Hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Or doesn't, or doesn't support the idea they were judging you.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I know I felt judged when I wasn't able to handle the merchandise.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, this is just like why can I handle the informa-- ah, the merchandise that I'm potentially going to buy.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Sure. And how did you answer that question when, when you had the thought, \"Why can't I?\" It's because?\nYOLANDA: Well initially I thought I attributed it to them.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. But, ah, they were making a judgment about you -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - right exactly. That maybe they thought you didn't have the money or you didn't, you know, you were black and they didn't wanna sell to you particularly.\nYOLANDA: Uhm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right? So, so some kind of a thought like popped up in your head, that they were judging you again.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. So, so in general I would say, Yolanda that if you get this question about why is this happening or, or why, why anything like, why won’t the sell to me or whatever, why can't I touch the merchandise. Usually we don't get the distressed unless we actually have an answer to those questions in our own hand.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And if it's just a question and usually we don't get, ah, we don't get sad or angry or whatever it’s when we think we know the answer then we get angry or so.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: Well, well it just like if somebody let's say even if we, we imagine the worst case that somebody actually made a negative statement about you.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. Do you have to have this thought that you're not good enough? Does, does one necessarily have to leave to the other conclusion? This kind of all or nothing thinking that I must better enough because somebody thinks poorly of me.\nYOLANDA: You know, I don't know, it doesn't necessarily have to-- I hope not.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah, ah, I-- yeah. So, so again are there some positive, is there some positive evidence that you can draw that you are good enough or you are a good person?\nYOLANDA: Sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So again you can think of some-- can you say something that good\nYOLANDA: I, I maybe I'm thinking too much on this particular situation. I don't know, uhm...\nKEITH S. DOBSON: So, so is there some evidence that doesn't support this idea that you're not good enough?\nYOLANDA: Sure.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah, yeah. And we probably got lots of it right from your life and from the-- to find the way you behave you schooling and...\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Right. You just got a job offer -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - that's-- there’s, there’s lots of evidence you could probably drop. So, so when you go this thought, you know, \"Am I not good enough?\" And use your, your assumption was well this must be true and you know to be self-critical but in fact if you look at the evidence that refutes this, there some on the other side too, okay? So we’re looking at the evidence primarily let's think then about well, what are some alternatives then? If there are some possibly some distortions and you weren't looking or sort of thinking while this in a balance way what might be a more balance more fact fitting. You know, accurate way of thinking about this situation instead of, \"Am I not good enough?\"\nYOLANDA: I am good enough. I'm good as any other person -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - shopping, ah, in their stores. Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm. I'm as good as anyone else here. Yeah. Okay. Uhm, maybe the problem isn't with you, maybe the problem is with them.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right. So, and again we don't know that. We don't know that, we don't wanna mind read but maybe they have a problem or a bias. Or we, we don't know. Again, maybe they're just being business, you know, bloody minded business people -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and it just wanna make us much money as they can, right? So, so they're not caring what other people's feeling they're just looking at the bottom line.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Possible? Right? So we don't know. I gue-- I guess it's part of it in this particular case we don't really know what their thoughts were but all this is predicated on your idea about what they thought about you.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: And that you jump to this conclusion that and maybe you're not good enough. If you were able to think about it like this at, at the moment, \"I'm as good as anyone else here, maybe they have a problem.\" How much sadness do you think you might have felt?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, 10% if even.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So 10% or less. Okay. So, so pretty much it drops drops down, right? Okay. So-- and there's anything else come up? There's any other fe-- feeling pop-up? \"I'm as good as anyone else, maybe they have a problem.\"\nYOLANDA: No, not right away.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: No? Okay. Some, sometimes people when they, they look at situations, you know, looking in terms of the evidence and the alternatives in fact some positive feelings pop-up so maybe not. But like for example, \"I'm as good as anyone else here\", you might say pride, you know.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Then-- but you, you may not feel that way, so that's fine. Okay. So we've have just taken a couple of the thoughts. You actually had several thoughts in the situation, what I wanted to do is use a couple of them as example is to show you how you can look for evidence again, you know, are these distorted potentially or not, look at the evidence, look at the alternatives and then see if you can come up with them ore balanced or reasonable alternatively of thinking about this situation and you see what happen of course in both cases if, if you could have done that you probably would have been feeling less angry and less sad.\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right? And maybe you might have had some positive feelings they understanding and maybe a little bit of pride or a little sense of, you know, indignation, you know, proper indignation that I'm just as good anybody else here. All right? So let's kinda take the edge off of the negative feelings -\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - e-- and opens up the possibility of this that you might actually start to feel better about yourself. That make sense?\nYOLANDA: It does.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Now, again if you were feeling less angry, less irritated, less sad and maybe a bit of pride, again do you think the behavior could have changed.\nYOLANDA: It's possible.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah it’s possible. I, I think what it does is it opens up the chance at least again for you then to make the decision about what we want to do based on your own best interest rather maybe than similar negative thoughts and the negative feelings. All right?\nYOLANDA: Yeaah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah? That make sense?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, does this sound like a useful framework for thinking about thoughts?\nYOLANDA: It does. It sounds like they can get a little-- I don't wanna say tricky but involve.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm, as of sound like that.\nYOLANDA: I guess, when you start thinking about, maybe not so much what is the evidence but I mean really considering the alternatives -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: It sounds like it, it get kind of involves like-- and maybe because if you're so use to thinking one way -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - and then you kinda training yourself to think or consider something else.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: That's right.\nYOLANDA: I think it, I think it can be little, little challenging.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. It's try-- it's trying to move you off, off the automatic thoughts that habitual patterns that a thought that you have and just sort of stopping in questioning yourself. And maybe at the end of it in fact that you come away with the idea that, you know they are cheap greedy people but the evidence really does support this and, and that's true. You know, in which case then in fact changing your thoughts isn't going to help that what you had need to do then is figuring out some strategy for dealing with cheap and greedy people.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",

DOBSON: Yeah. Right? And rather than reacting to things -\nYOLANDA: All right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - emotionally you can think about what's your best interest.\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Make sense?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Uhm, so what I would like to propose for homework is that you practice this exercise like not just the, the first columns but the whole exercise the best we can when some situation pop-up.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Does sound possible? Okay.\nYOLANDA: I will do my best.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. Yeah-- well, you're, you're doing great. I mean, you know, I don't, I don't know how hard this is for your but, you know, I mean what you're writing down is exactly the kind of work that I'd like to see. Does feel, is this make sense though?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay.\nYOLANDA: It make sense.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Now the one thing we haven't talk toward so much is this last question, this little white question. And that's actually little bit trickier and, and normally when I work with people I don't talk too much about that, the first time I introduce this -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - like first I think if you can get looking at these first two questions that's a good start. And what I propose is that and again I'm hoping we'll have another session but, that when we have the next session you can then see how well you're doing with these two questions and then we can come back to this a little bit. All right? But this question, ah, just, just very briefly what it leads to is the idea that, uhm, for example let's say that the evidence really supported the idea that you're not good enough that you're failing in some way. That you, you know, that there's something wrong with or cuz something like that. Or what would that mean? Is that mean you still have to be sad and that you still have to not shop or you have to withdraw?\nYOLANDA: No.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Not necessarily, right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: But I, but I think it's a little bit harder to answer that question -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - if, if we look at the evidence and look at the alternatives and it's really tough to do anything different than the original negative thought. But, but that's why I like to look at that a little bit later. So, once you got this first three down a little bit more.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay? So, ah, again I hope we get there next time, ah, if not what I will do is I'll certainly way out some, some more description how is this can be done -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - this, this kind of work. And, ah, then you'll be able to work on that either by yourself or maybe with another counselor. That make sense?\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So, I give you that and this actually some more here, some more sheets so I'll give you many sheets or you can have them all. So there's lots of opportunities here if you have lots of negative thoughts.\nYOLANDA: No.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: No. No, seriously, just as many as are appropriate you can, you can do.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Okay. So we had a chance then to work through those thoughts. We look at the situation you, you got another continuing kind of assignment which builds on what we've been doing, any reactions overall?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I mean I like the idea that, ah, it sounds like I'm being empowered like I don't have to think, you know, this automatic thoughts like-- I mean I have a choice -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm, exactly.\nYOLANDA: - and I don't have to like you were saying I don’t have to respond to, you know, this automatic thoughts I'm happen-- ah, that I'm having I can actually, you know, I can choose -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: - uhm,-- I mean cuz it can feel like it's ha-- it's happening so naturally that, you know, it just I guess you can feel like it is, uhm, I don't wanna say taking over but it just happens so naturally.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Eh-- eh-- anyway-- but it anyway it does. And in fact often when you have this automatic thoughts and you just act as if they're true -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - they'll almost become self-fulfilling.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Right? Yeah.\nYOLANDA: So I like the idea of, you know me being in control.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Uh-hmm.\nYOLANDA: Uhm, and then, ah, like I was saying the challenge is really considering the alternative thought -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah.\nYOLANDA: - because like there's a such a pattern of in a way of thinking that you just don't even consider that there might be an alternative.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Ah, absolutely right. And, and if we again-- and if we have more sessions what we can do is we can actually over time and look these patterns of the original automatic thoughts and we can actually track them back to your core beliefs.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Cuz a lot of them pop-up not just because of the situation and they're, they're almost from the situational -\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - but they almost always will have some kind of tie into your core beliefs -\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Like the feeling of not being good enough we've talked about before. All right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: As one of the ones and so here's the situation in where that pops up again. So, of course because you carry around this general beliefs they’re going to tend to pop-up in different situations. Yeah.\nYOLANDA: Okay.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. So part of the idea here is breaking those patters giving you a chance to stop and look at them and evaluate them, you know, and decide if they fit the facts or not and if not to change them, that’s right andgive you more power to do that. All right? So this is part of the process again this, this takes time.\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: You know, you know, you’ve had years of working with your automatic thoughts -\nYOLANDA: Right.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: - and not questioning them. So it takes a while to learn to stop and, and look at the facts. So, so it's not easy, okay? But you've got a great, you've got a good response, yeah. Good. Anything else you wanna say tonight?\nYOLANDA: Uhm, I hope I get to come back -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. Yeah.\nYOLANDA: - at least for one -\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. I do too.\nYOLANDA: - session.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: I do too. Yeah. So you can work with the people here again and if you get that out, and if not I wish you well and I will certainly send you the notes and they'll give you information so you can carry this work on with a, with a counselor. Ah you are seeing somebody here I think, right?\nYOLANDA: Uh-hmm.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Yeah. So, I don't know if you'd be able to pick up with them again, maybe not if you're working depending on the time.\nYOLANDA: Yeah. It's gonna be pretty impossible.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: You think so?\nYOLANDA: Yeah.\nKEITH S. DOBSON: Let's see that. Okay. Well if I don't see you again I wish you the best.\nYOLANDA: Thank you.\n\n```\n\nJust output the updated psychological template:\n",
